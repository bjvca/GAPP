*have been usual members of this household, but have been away for more than six months during the last 12 months, for education purposes, search of
*employment, business transactions etc. and living in boarding schools, lodging houses or hostels etc.*These will be coded "3" or "4" depending upon presence 
*or absence on the date of the interview. For the purposes of the calculation of a poverty line we'll exclude from the household the members who have left
