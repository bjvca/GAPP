***------- Interview Quarter
* For the Mozambique Data, instead of using the regular quarter definition for their "surquar" variable they defined the quarters
* relative to the time period covered by the survey: the survey ran from Sept 2008 to August 2009 so they defined the quarters

*household for 6 months or more during the last 12 months. members who have come to stay in the household permanently usual members, even though they have 
*lived in this household for less than 6 *months. children born to usual members during the last 12 months are usual members. Both these categories will 
*be given code "1" or "2" depending upon whether they are present or absent on the date of the interview. *Regular members refer to those persons who would 
*have been usual members of this household, but have been away for more than six months during the last 12 months, for education purposes, search of
*employment, business transactions etc. and living in boarding schools, lodging houses or hostels etc.*These will be coded "3" or "4" depending upon presence 
*or absence on the date of the interview. For the purposes of the calculation of a poverty line we'll exclude from the household the members who have left 
*the household permanently or died We'll keep the members away for more than 6 months but present on the day of the interview */
