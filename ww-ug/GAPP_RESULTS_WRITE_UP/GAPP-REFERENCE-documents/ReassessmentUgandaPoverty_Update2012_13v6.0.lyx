\begin_layout Abstract
Official poverty figures in Uganda are flawed by the fact that the underlying
 poverty lines are based on a single national food basket that was constructed
 in the early 1990s.
 In this paper, we estimate a new set of poverty lines that accounts for
 the widely divergent diets throughout the country using the latest available
 household survey.
 Using these updated poverty lines, we then look at poverty dynamics using
 four waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey.
 We classify households into categories depending on their change in poverty
 status over time and relate this to characteristics that are likely to
 change only slowly.
 This enables us to explore the characteristics of households that, for
 instance, grow out of poverty and how they differ from households that
 appear to be trapped in poverty.
 Our approach generates poverty measures that are more credible from a theoretic
al point of view and are more in line with what other researchers find.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the past few decades, Uganda has experienced substantial economic
 growth.
 Since 1986, when the National Resistance Movement took over government,
 real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annual rate of 6.8 percent,
 making its economy one of the fastest growing in Africa.
 This growth has been attributed to the new government that has implemented
 a far-reaching economic reforms agenda, transforming Uganda into one of
 the most liberal economies in Africa south of the Sahara.
 Indeed, as argued in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

after "p. 42"
key "WB193"

\end_inset

, the government 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

liberalized the trade regime by abolishing export and import licensing;
 dismantled all price controls, which were few to begin with; repealed the
 Industrial Licensing Act, promulgated a new investment code, returned propertie
s expropriated by the Amin regime and commenced privatizing public industrial
 enterprises; made important strides in abolishing export and distribution
 monopolies; embarked upon a major overhaul of the civil service; restructured
 the tax system and improved tax administration; and has made an impressive
 start in restructuring public expenditures towards critical economic and
 social services
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Such policy changes were seen as essential pre-conditions for sustainable
 economic growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This growth has been accompanied by equally impressive declines in the levels
 of poverty as reported by the government.
 While aggregate headcount poverty stood at about 57 percent in the early
 1990s, the most recent official estimate puts 19.5 percent of the population
 below the official poverty line.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the most recent official estimate, we take the poverty estimate based
 on the 2012/2013 Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS).
 The data on which these estimates are based were obtained from the Uganda
 Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) in August 2014.
 As is mostly the case with UNHS data obtained from UBOS, the dataset came
 with a pre-compiled welfare aggregate based on consumption expenditure
 and a set of official poverty lines.
 Using the same methods we used to replicate official poverty figures in
 previous rounds of the UNHS, we estimate national headcount poverty to
 be 19.5 percent in the UNHS 2012/2013.
 This is slightly lower than official poverty estimates at the time of the
 UNHS 2012/2013 dissemination and reported in the press (22.1 percent).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 But despite these successes at the aggregate level, researchers warn that
 this growth has not been shared equally by the population at large.
 For instance, marked spatial heterogeneity in baseline poverty and subsequent
 poverty reductions mean that differences in the standard of living between
 locations are often much higher now than what they used to be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the observed heterogeneity in terms of poverty and poverty reduction,
 the figures itself have been called into question as well.
 Some argue that the lack of progress on assets accumulation and nonmonetary
 well-being proxies suggest much more modest poverty reductions, raising
 suspicion about the poverty lines and the welfare indicator used by the
 government of Uganda 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "New10,New4"

\end_inset

.
 Some scholars have also been questioning the spatial pattern of poverty
 as reported in official documents, arguing that a single national food
 poverty line is likely to overstate poverty in some areas while underestimating
 poverty in others

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we want to update existing knowledge about the state of poverty
 and its dynamics in Uganda, while at the same time address some of the
 problems with the official figures that have been identified in recent
 studies.
 To account for differences in diets in different locations, we will construct
 different poverty thresholds for different spatial domains using the latest
 available nationally representative household survey (UNHS 2012/2013).
 For each spatial domain, we construct a food basket that produces a certain
 minimum of calories that reflects the diets of the poorest households in
 that region.
 These baskets are then multiplied by prices prevailing in that region to
 arrive at food poverty lines.
 An allowance for basic nonfood necessities is then added to get a set of
 Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) poverty lines, one in each spatial domain.
 We then test these poverty lines to see if they are utility-consistent.
 The idea is that a basic needs bundle in a certain spatial domain A should
 always be cheaper than a bundle from any other region valued at prices
 of region A.
 If a bundle does not satisfy these revealed preference conditions, we use
 an information theoretic approach to adjust the bundles until they do,
 as outlined in

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While comparing poverty estimates using these new poverty lines with the
 official estimates is interesting in its own right, we will use the utility-con
sistent poverty lines to look at poverty dynamics using the recently released
 Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS).
 The UNPS is a yearly panel survey collected by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics
 (UBOS) supported by the World Bank's Living Standard Measurement Study
 (LSMS) project that tracks about 3,000 households.
 We can use the panel nature of this survey to study how many households
 are chronically poor (defined as always falling below the poverty threshold)
 and investigate how their characteristics differ from other groups, such
 as households that successfully escaped poverty.
 In other words, we will construct a detailed poverty profile that takes
 dynamic aspects into account, defining groups based on poverty transitions
 instead of a simple dichotomous poor/nonpoor status 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Boateng01031992"

\end_inset

.
 As for the characteristics we contrast within each group, we confine ourselves
 to those that change only slowly over time, and we look at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

initial conditions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the start of the panel.
 We hope that this can enlighten us on the preconditions that need to be
 in place to be in a particular poverty dynamics group.

For example, we could check if households that are always below the poverty
 line are different in terms of their reported ability to cope with adverse
 shocks at the start of the panel from those that grow out of poverty over
 the course of the panel.

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: We first give an overview
 of poverty in the past few decades and look at the present official poverty
 estimates in Uganda.
 We also present some studies that point to shortcomings in official poverty
 measurement.
 In Section 3, we briefly explain the reasoning behind the use of spatially
 disaggregated poverty lines and the role of revealed preferences to test
 for utility consistency.
 Section 4 presents the construction of the new set of poverty lines and
 our poverty estimates based on the UNHS 2012/2013.
 Section 5 then looks at poverty dynamics and relates households with differing
 poverty dynamics to a selection of characteristics.
 A final section concludes.

Poverty in Uganda: Trends and Controversies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the 1990s, poverty in Uganda decreased substantially, falling by
 almost 40 percent at the national level.
 Table

, presents official headcount poverty rates before the year 2000.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a substantial literature on poverty and its dynamics in the 1990s.
 This is because of the relatively high quality data available for this
 period.
 Uganda has been conducting national household surveys since 1992, and conducted
 six such surveys before the turn of the millennium.
 Some of these datasets form a panel.
 The first dataset, the Integrated Household Survey conducted in 1992/1993
 can be linked to the last survey of the millennium, referred to as the
 first Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS 1999/2000).
 Between these two surveys, a series of four Monitoring Surveys (1993/1994
 up to 1997/1998) was carried out.
 More information on these data sets can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, this table also shows significant spatial differences in both
 levels and changes in poverty.
 The urban areas and Central region reduce poverty the fastest.
 The Northern region, already starting from high levels of poverty, is relativel
y unsuccessful in bringing down the number of people living below the poverty
 line.
 In addition, studies that exploit the panel nature of the data find that
 in some regions, poverty is particularly persistent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DPR:DPR220"

\end_inset

.
 Also puzzling is the sudden drop between 1997/1998 and 1999/2000.
 Although it took 5 years for poverty to decrease by 20 percent between
 1992 and 1997, it took only 2 years to decrease another 20 percent at the
 turn of the century.
 This may be due to inconsistent underlying welfare indicator data that
 were obtained from different surveys (the Monitoring Surveys and the Uganda
 National Household Survey, see footnote 3).

One controversy we will also address in this paper refers to the fact that
 the official poverty estimates are based on poverty lines that are rooted
 in a single food consumption bundle, derived from 1993/1994 Monitoring
 Survey data.
 In particular, a single food basket was identified at the national level
 with 28 of the most frequently consumed food items by households with less
 than the median income.
 The items in this food basket were then converted into caloric equivalents
 and scaled to generate 3,000 calories per adult equivalent per day using
 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates for an 18‐30-year-old male
 as a reference.
 Next, a nonfood allowance was added.
 Nonfood requirements were estimated as the average nonfood expenditure
 of those households whose total expenditure was around the food poverty
 line.
 The nonfood allowance does allow for spatial heterogeneity, as separate
 averages were calculated for urban and rural locations interacted with
 the four regions (Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western), using the method
 described in

 As far as we know, these poverty lines have since been updated by the official
 inflation figures each time a new household survey came out.

 argue that Uganda is unusual in its dietary diversity.
 Indeed, Uganda has five different staples, matooke, maize, sweet potatoes,
 cassava, and millet that are more or less important within the diet depending
 on the region.
 This may not matter very much if the diets are equally cost-effective in
 obtaining the same level of basic needs as defined in kilocalories.
 However, the staple food of choice of a large part of the population, both
 in the Western and the Central regions, is matooke, a highly localized
 staple.

 source of calories, compared with what people in, for instance, the north
 consume.

 Even after correcting for income difference, as regions that consume more
 expensive calories may do so simply because they have higher incomes,

 region as the poorest.

Progress in fighting poverty reported by the government of Uganda and UBOS
 in the first decade of the new millennium is equally impressive.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that poverty at the national level kept falling during the first
 decade, shaving another 50 percent off of headcount poverty.
 At the same time, differential progress in poverty reduction in different
 regions persists, too.
 For instance, by 2012/2013, poverty is more than eight times higher in
 the Northern region than in the Central region.
 In 2002/2003, the north was only 2.7 times poorer than the Central region.
 The more disaggregated the numbers, the starker the contrasts become.
 In the northeast, a semi-arid area with low rainfall inhabited by the Karamajon
g, an agropastoralist ethnic group, poverty remains stubbornly high, while
 in the Central and Western regions of the country, poverty is almost eradicated.

 use Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data and methods related to poverty
 mapping and small area estimation to look at poverty trends across Uganda
 from 1995 to 2010.
 They use the 2005/2006 UNHS survey to estimate regressions that correlate
 poverty to a range of household characteristics that also appear in the
 DHS (four such surveys have been carried out between 1995 and 2009/2010).
 They then use the DHS surveys to predict poverty in each of the DHS survey
 years.
 They find that poverty indeed reduced over time, but much slower than official
 figures suggest.
 While their national estimate of headcount poverty in 2006 is 33 percent
 and thus very close to the official estimate of 2005/2006, the rate still
 stands as 30 percent using the 2009 DHS, about 6 percentage points higher
 than the 2009/2010 UNHS estimate.

 Recently, an unpublished manuscript has been circulating that compares
 Uganda to other African countries on six nonmonetary poverty indicators,
 such as literacy rates and access to piped water.
 This admittedly partial analysis also points to a much higher incidence
 of poverty than officially reported.

Utility-Consistent Poverty Lines Using Revealed Preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above, we learn that one of the main weaknesses of the official
 poverty measures is that they are based on a poverty line that is constructed
 using a single food commodity bundle for the entire country.
 In addition, this food basket was constructed in 1993 and has not been
 updated since, apart from accounting for simple inflation by the consumption
 price index.
 However, it is well known that in many instances - for example, if relative
 prices of basic commodities vary by region (or through time) and preferences
 permit substitution - the use of a single consumption bundle may yield
 inconsistent poverty comparisons

.
 While differences in prices in different locations are usually incorporated
 in poverty measurement by adjusting the welfare indicator to reflect prices
 used in the construction of the poverty lines (or by adjusting the poverty
 lines to reflect prices used in the construction of the welfare indicator),
 it is becoming more and more common to also account for spatial heterogeneity
 in consumption bundles in an effort to increase the 
\emph on
specificity
\emph default
 of poverty lines (e.g.

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While differences in consumption baskets are interesting in their own right,
 they become relevant only in the context of poverty measurement and analysis,
 as we relate a welfare indicator to the cost of these basic needs.
 Indeed, different diets may provide the same basic needs (usually a given
 amount of kilocalories per day) at significantly different costs, which
 complicates poverty comparisons between units (regions, households, individuals
, and so forth) with different diets.
 It is especially in this regard that Uganda provides an interesting study.
 Matooke, the main ingredient in the diet of households in the west, may
 be more or less expensive per energy unit than, for example, sorghum, the
 main staple in the north.
 As such, it would be misleading to compare the west with the north on the
 basis of a single food poverty line, even after allowing for spatial price
 heterogeneity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how can we be sure that two different consumption bundles provide the
 same basic needs? Or, in the language of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

? The theory underlying absolute poverty lines is grounded in welfare economics
 and constrained utility maximization.
 In this context, the fixed standard of living represented by the poverty
 line is viewed as a level of utility associated with the minimally acceptable
 standard of living.
 Different poverty lines will be utility-consistent if the underlying bundles
 of goods are on the Hicksian utility-compensated demand functions and hence
 yield the same level of utility

 In other words, two bundles of goods are consistent if they yield the same
 utility.

 argue, the theory of revealed preferences provides a framework for answering
 these questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea uses the rationality assumption that economic agents that derive
 utility from consumption always prefer consuming more to less.
 Let us assume that a representative agent living in spatial domain 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(r\in R)$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
derives utility from a set of consumption goods (
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

).
 We will then instruct each representative consumer in each spatial domain
 
\emph on
r 
\emph default
to spend a minimum to attain an arbitrary (but constant across spatial domains)
 level of utility.
 As such, each individual will spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 on a consumption bundle, with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the price of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the quantity of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
.
 Revealed preference conditions will then imply that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r'}\geq\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}\;\forall r,r'.\label{eq:revpref}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is so because the representative consumer in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 will choose only that bundle that minimizes expenditure.
 Thus, any other bundle that yields the same level of utility (such as,
 for instance, the one chosen by the representative consumer in region 
\emph on
r'
\emph default
) should be equally expensive as or more expensive than the chosen bundle.
 No bundle can cost less than the chosen one yet yield that same utility,
 because then the rational consumer should have chosen that one.
 Or, as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:y:2003:v:52:i:1:p:159-85"

\end_inset

, if the cost of a bundle from another domain would be cheaper if bought
 in a specific domain, this means it must have lower utility than the bundle
 in that specific domain, as otherwise the rational consumer would have
 picked the bundle from the other domain.
 The above condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:revpref"

\end_inset

 should hold for all possible pairs of spatial domains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, however, it will be hard to construct a set of poverty lines
 that meet revealed preference conditions for all possible pairs of spatial
 domains.
 One approach, which we will use in this paper, uses a minimum cross-entropy
 approach to adjust expenditure shares such that they meet revealed preference
 conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:58:y:2010:i:3:p:449-474"

\end_inset

.
 This approach uses the expenditure shares of the original bundles as prior
 information (in the form of probabilities that an arbitrarily small amount
 of money will be devoted to the purchase of the particular good) and the
 revealed preference conditions as constraints on the values that the parameters
 can take.
 The end result will be a set of adjusted expenditure shares that are as
 close as possible to the original shares, yet that obey a minimal set of
 conditions such that the estimated bundles are consistent with some arbitrary
 unknown preference set.

A Reassessment of Poverty in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this reassessment of poverty in Uganda, we will mainly work with the
 four waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS).
 The UNPS is a multitopic panel household survey started by UBOS in 2009/2010.
 However, the 2009/2010 sample was essentially a subset of 3,123 households
 that were interviewed as part of the 2005/2006 Uganda National Household
 Survey (UNHS 2005/2006), a nationally representative survey that covered
 6,775 households.
 As such, the first wave of the panel comprises the UNHS 2005/2006 data
 of this subsample of 3,123 households.
 After the second wave of 2009/10, the survey was repeated annually.
 Currently data are available for a third round covering the 2010/2011 agricultu
ral year and a fourth round covering the 2011/2012 agricultural year.

For the construction of the utility-consistent poverty thresholds elaborated
 on in the previous section, we will use the 2012/2013 Uganda National Household
 Survey (UNHS 2012/2013).
 Just as the UNHS 2005/2006, the UNHS 2012/2013 is nationally representative,
 this time covering 6,888 households.
 We choose this survey because it is the most recent one available, and
 the construction of utility-consistent poverty lines requires a sufficiently
 large sample, with sufficient observations in each spatial domain.
 The larger dataset allows us to experiment with different degrees of spatial
 disaggregation for the domains.
 It also allows us to define poverty lines at a more disaggregated level
 than the maximum level of disaggregation for which the UNPS is deemed represent
ative.

 Our baseline case will look at poverty measures based on a singe national
 poverty line using a single spatial domain, as this would be close to simply
 updating the current official poverty line.
 This will then be compared to an analysis based on six separate spatial
 domains (Kampala, Rural Central, Rural East, Rural North, Rural West, and
 Other Urban).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:58:y:2010:i:3:p:449-474"

\end_inset

, we start by constructing food bundles in each spatial domain.
 In each domain, a basket of food products that satisfies basic calorie
 needs is identified using information on the age and sex composition of
 the households and the recorded consumption patterns of poorer households.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 bundles is based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The cost of this basket, valued at prices prevailing within each spatial
 domain, results in a set of food poverty lines, one in each spatial domain.
 Nonfood poverty lines are obtained by calculating the share of food expenditure
s for households whose total food and nonfood consumption per capita is
 near the food poverty line.
 Total poverty lines are obtained as the sum of the food and the nonfood
 poverty lines.
 These poverty lines are then compared, to make sure that they are utility-consi
stent.
 In particular, we compare the cost of a bundle in one spatial domain to
 the bundles in the other spatial domains, but evaluated at the price in
 this spatial domain.
 As stated above, revealed preferences states that the cost of the bundle
 in the spatial domain should be smaller or equal to the bundles chosen
 in any other spatial domain.
 If this condition is violated, we use a minimum cross-entropy framework
 to adjust consumption shares in such a way that revealed preference conditions
 are satisfied.

\begin_layout Standard
It can be instructive to have a closer look at the poverty lines.
 After all, poverty lines are not only useful to separate the rich from
 the poor, but also serve as deflators for cost-of-living differences, permittin
g interpersonal welfare comparisons when the cost of acquiring basic needs
 varies over time or space

 It is not possible to directly compare the utility-consistent poverty lines

 Instead, the official poverty measures incorporate spatial price difference

 The cost of living seems to be highest in Central region.
 The Western region comes in second.
 This is consistent with the findings of

 and is caused by the low energy content and relatively high price of matooke,
 a staple grown and consumed mostly in the Western and Central regions.
 Households in the Eastern region, on the other hand, consume a lot of cassava,
 mostly in dried or flour form, which is only three times as costly but
 more than eight times as nutritious.
 While the 2012/2013 poverty lines are directly derived from the 2012/2013
 UNHS, the poverty lines for the other years are simply deflated using the
 Consumer Price Index.
 Poverty lines are expressed in Ugandan shillings per person per day.

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now look at the evolution of poverty during the recent past.
 We will present two sets of results.
 The first set of results, reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-1spdomain"

\end_inset

, uses only one spatial domain.
 In other words, we estimate a single national poverty line based on a single
 national food basket.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This national poverty line was estimated to be 1233.42, see first row in
 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Utility-Consistent-Poverty"

\end_inset

 in the appendix.
 One may be surprised that the poverty line based on a single spatial domain
 is so low, and below all of the other poverty lines estimated in the six
 regions, instead of somewhere in between.
 This is because, using only one spatial domain essentially means that a
 single poverty line is constructed based on the lowest cost and lowest
 consuming rural zones.
 This leads to a low poverty line, closer to the lowest poverty line using
 different spatial domains (Eastern region) than to the highest poverty
 line (Kampala).
 The fact that the poverty line using one spatial domain is actually below
 the lowest poverty line when different spatial domains are used is due
 to the utility consistency adjustments.
 Poverty lines for the Central and Eastern regions are significantly adjusted
 upward, lifting them above the poverty line using a single spatial domain.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We do this because, in a way, this would be the closest to simply updating
 the official poverty line, that is based on one single national consumption
 basket.
 Second, we will present results for an analysis that uses the six spatial
 domains mentioned above (Kampala, Rural Central, Rural East, Rural North,
 Rural West, and Other Urban).
 The results are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-6spdomains"

\begin_layout Standard
Poverty headcounts using one spatial domain as reported in table

 are much lower than the official headcounts reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Official-poverty-headcount00s"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, the national estimate in 2005/2006 is about 10 percentage
 points lower than the official estimates.
 However, the reduction in poverty between 2005/2006 and 2009/2010 (7.4 percent)
 is much smaller than in the official figures (more than 20 percent).
 There is a slight increase in poverty in 2010/2011, but national headcount
 poverty falls to about 16 percent in 2011/2012.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While part of the increase in 2010/2011 is likely caused by the increase
 in food prices, data problems provide an additional explanation.
 For instance, simple counts of how many households report consuming a particula
r commodity point to some severe problems.
 In 2010/2011 only about 300 household report consuming sweet potatoes,
 while this is around 1,400 in the other rounds.
 For cassava, in 2010/2011 only 562 household report consumption, versus
 again about 1,400 in all other rounds of the UNPS.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Overall, the reduction in poverty between 2005/2006 and 2012/2013 was about
 the same as in the official figures at around 37 percent, most of this
 coming about in the two last years of the panel.
 The spatial patterns are the same, as both these and the official estimates
 are based on a single poverty line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The national poverty headcounts are much higher than the official ones if
 we use six spatial domains (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-6spdomains"

\end_inset

).
 While 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "New10"

\end_inset

 argue that the original 1993 poverty lines may have increased too little
 to keep pace with inflation and that differences in the measurement of
 consumption may contribute to the underestimation of poverty, we find that
 consumption bundle aggregation also seems to depress poverty figures.
 The reductions in poverty also seem more modest than the official ones,
 with an overall reduction in poverty between 2005/2006 and 2012/2013 of
 about one quarter.
 We also see that the largest reduction the number of people living below
 the poverty line happened between 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.
 However, if we look at the evolution of the poverty gap (as reported in
 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-gap-2002-2012"

\end_inset

 in the Appendix), the largest reduction is between 2010/2011 and 2011/2012.
 This suggests quite some mobility below the poverty line between 2010/2011
 and 2011/2012.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we disaggregate between rural and urban poverty, we see that most of
 the poverty reduction has been happening in rural areas.
 Over the years, poverty in rural areas has steadily fallen from almost
 50 percent to 36 percent.
 This is different from what has been happening in urban areas.
 While between 2005/2006 and 2010/2011 urban poverty was on the decline,
 it started rising again afterwards.
 A marked acceleration in urban poverty between 2011/2012 and 2012/2013
 together with a steady decline in rural poverty reduced the contribution
 of rural poverty to overall poverty from about 94 percent to 88 percent
 in 2012/2013.
 The evolution of official figures is in line with our findings, except
 that we find a much stronger rebound of urban poverty.

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we disaggregate poverty by region.
 We find that in the Northern region, which is the poorest, poverty has
 decreased by 15 percent over the entire period.
 However, the evolution was far from linear.
 Especially between 2009/2010 and 2010/2011, there was a strong reduction
 in poverty.
 But since then, poverty in the Northern region has been rising again.
 The tables in the appendix show that, especially in 2012/2013, not only
 headcount poverty but also the poverty gap and the severity of poverty
 has been increasing.
 Official poverty figures report a reduction of 28 percent between 2005/2006
 and 2012/2013 in headcount poverty, very close to what we find using only
 one spatial domain (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-1spdomain"

\end_inset

).
 The Western region is, just as in the official estimates, the second richest
 region.
 However, it is now 55 percent poorer than the richest region.
 This gap between the Western and Central regions is significantly larger
 than in the official statistics, where poverty rates in the Western region
 are 33 percent higher than in the Eastern region.
 Thus, while we do not observe the changes in the rankings observed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:12:y:2003:i:4:p:598-624"

\end_inset

, our results are consistent with the finding that the west is poorer than
 official figures suggest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Central region, already the least poor region at the start of the panel,
 reduced headcount poverty by half between 2005/2006 and 2012/2013 according
 to our estimates using six spatial domains.
 Again, official estimates record higher poverty reductions (almost 70 percent),
 which is again similar to what we find in our estimates using only one
 spatial domain.
 Inequality in poverty headcount has also increased over time.
 While the Northern region initially contributed 27 percent to overall poverty,
 this has increased to 37 percent in 2012/2013.
 The contribution of the Eastern region also has increased substantially.
 And while severity of poverty has reduced in the Northern region, in 2012/2013,
 almost 60 percent of the national severity of poverty measure was contributed
 by the North.
 If we disaggregate the 2012/2013 data further, we find that most poverty
 is found in the northeast, where over 80 percent of the individuals live
 in poverty.
 This is followed by West Nile, a distant second with 60 percent of the
 population living in poverty.

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, we feel that the poverty measures and the evolution of poverty
 over time are much more credible, both from a theoretical and an empirical
 point of view.
 The continued use of outdated poverty lines based on a single food basket
 is likely to lead to inconsistent poverty estimates, especially in a country
 where different regions have widely varying diets.
 Indeed, most of the staples in these diets are effectively nontradables,
 deriving their price from local demand and supply conditions.
 The result is that the cost of basic needs, even though anchored in a single
 caloric requirement, may vary significantly.
 We also feel that the poverty levels, as well as the estimated reduction
 in poverty, are closer to what other researchers have deemed more realistic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
A Profile Based on Poverty Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we developed a new set of poverty lines above, in this section,
 we will use the Uganda National Panel to construct profiles for different
 categories of households based on the evolution of their poverty status
 over time.
 We will start by defining five different categories.
 The first category consist of households that are identified as being poor
 in all four waves of the UNPS.
 We will refer to these households as the 
\emph on
chronic 
\emph default
poor.
 Second, we will identify the households that were never poor in any of
 the waves.
 These households will be grouped in the 
\emph on
nonpoor
\emph default
 group.
 Next, we delineate a group of households that are 
\emph on
escaping
\emph default
 poverty.
 These are households that are poor in all past waves but nonpoor in all
 subsequent waves.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This group comprises households that are poor in 2005/2006 and nonpoor in
 all subsequent rounds, those that are poor in 2005/2006 and 2009/2010 and
 nonpoor in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, and those that are poor in 2005/2006,
 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and nonpoor in 2011/2012.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A fourth group will then consist of those households that are 
\emph on
falling
\emph default
 into poverty.
 These are households that are nonpoor in all past waves but poor in all
 subsequent waves.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This group comprises households that are nonpoor in 2005/2006 and poor in
 all subsequent rounds, those that are nonpoor in 2005/2006 and 2009/2010
 and poor in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, and those that are nonpoor in 2005/2006,
 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and poor in 2011/2012.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Finally, there is a category for the rest.
 These households, repeatedly moving in and out of poverty, are labeled
 as 
\emph on
vulnerable
\emph default
 in our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at poverty transitions using the above typology, we find that only
 about 257 of the 2,195
\emph on
 
\emph default
households that appear in all four waves are poor in each wave.
 This amounts to only 11.7 percent of the households being chronic poor.
 However, if we weigh these households by population weights, the number
 of chronic poor individuals increases to 12.3 percent.
 This suggests that the chronic poor tend to live in larger households.
 At the other extreme, we find that 833 households, or 37.9 percent of the
 households, are never poor, corresponding to about 35.8 percent when using
 weights.
 Next, 387 households have escaped poverty and 198 have fallen into poverty,
 corresponding to 19.0 and 8.2 percent of the population, respectively.
 Finally, there is a sizable class of about 520 vulnerable households, or
 almost a quarter of the population, that moves into or out of poverty,
 possibly multiple times, over the four waves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now relate these four categories of households to various household
 characteristics to come up with a profile, similar to poverty profiles
 in a static analysis of poverty.
 Since we are interested in the likely causes of poverty transitions (as
 opposed to the likely consequences of poverty transitions), we will look
 at characteristics of the household at the first wave of the panel in 2005/2006.
 In other words, the profile will help us understand why households have
 fared differently in terms of poverty status because of a different past.
 As such, we will also concentrate on characteristics that change only slowly
 over time, as opposed to those that may change significantly from year
 to year, such as crops cultivated.
 In a way, we want to identify the preconditions at the household level
 associated with different poverty transition trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Location and well-being are often found to be correlated.
 In virtually all cases, poverty is found to be higher in rural areas than
 in urban.
 More in general, remote areas tend to be poorer for a myriad of reasons.
 For instance, one prominent economic reason is that in sparsely populated
 areas with a thin road network that is often in bad shape, transaction
 costs are high, affecting economic activity

 But 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 note that agroecology; institutional, political, and governance failures;
 service delivery; stigma and exclusion; crime and insecurity; and communication
, media, and information and communication technologies are all factors
 that are mediated by remoteness and as such likely to contribute to special
 poverty traps.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first look at the location of households in the five classes in terms
 of being in urban or rural areas.
 Of all the chronic poor, 97.7 percent live in rural areas.
 Of all the nonpoor, this is only 71.9 percent.
 For Uganda as a whole, 86.7 percent reports to be living in rural areas.
 Going one step further, we look at the three groups by region.
 This is visualized in the mosaic plot in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Regional-Poverty-Dynamics"

\end_inset

.
 The figure clearly shows that chronic poverty is concentrated in the Northern
 region.
 Here, 45.5 percent of all the chronic poor can be found.
 On the other end, the households that never experienced poverty are disproporti
onately located in the Central region: More than 44 percent of the people
 that are always above the poverty threshold live there.
 If one lives in the Eastern region, one has a relatively higher chance
 of falling into poverty.
 People living in the Western region seem to be moving in and out of poverty
 more than people living in other regions.
 While the Northern region has a large group of chronic poor, the good news
 is that the relative share of people escaping poverty is larger than the
 share that fall into poverty.
 This is different in the Eastern region, where the large share of individuals
 sliding into poverty happens simultaneously with relatively few people
 escaping poverty.
 Finally, it is worth noting that, despite the already high presence of
 nonpoor in the Central region, many poor households have escaped poverty
 over time and very few households have slipped back into poverty.

As mentioned above, location also affects access to services, such as safe
 drinking water.
 Figure

 provides kernel density plots for time reported to fetch drinking water
 including waiting time.
 You can see that respondents cluster their answers around 2 hours and 4
 hours.
 We find that, in general, the nonpoor need to spend less time fetching
 water, except maybe for some nonpoor that spend about 2 hours.
 The median for the nonpoor is about 50 minutes, as opposed to about 60
 minutes for the chronic poor.
 The respective means are 63 minutes for the nonpoor and 77 for the poor.
 This is also illustrated by the fact that the chronic poor have higher
 densities at the extreme right of the distribution, for instance around
 4 hours, or 240 minutes.
 The vulnerable have a high density around 2 hours.

Household Demographics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The size and composition of the household are also variables that often
 feature in poverty regressions.
 For instance, many studies find that household size is a good poverty indicator.
 It is thought that increased competition for a given food stock reduces
 consumption.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ecj:econjl:v:105:y:1995:i:433:p:1415-34"

\end_inset

 argue that the negative correlation disappears as one takes economies of
 scale in household food consumption into account.
 In terms of production, a larger household may mean more and cheaper labor
 is available, but 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "newbjorn"

\end_inset

 finds that especially mothers in larger households devote a significant
 amount of time to non-productive activities.
 This last feature may be captured better when using relating the different
 types of household in terms of poverty dynamics to dependency ratios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Female-headedness is also often found to be a good predictor of poverty.
 The underlying reasons should be sought in differences between male-headed
 and female-headed households in terms of access to secure land tenure,
 labor, credit, technology, and extension services (eg.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Quisumbing2010581"

\end_inset

).
 One of the consequences is that female-headed households employ fewer inputs,
 such as improved seeds and fertilizer, which has been shown to reduce productiv
ity (eg.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Udry1995407"

\end_inset

).
 We will also look at marital status as an alternative way to look at gender-bas
ed agricultural gaps.
 This will enable us to see if, for instance, widowhood is associated with
 chronic poverty

\begin_layout Standard
We find that indeed, chronic poor households are more likely to be headed
 by a female.
 In addition, households that were never poor in our panel, as well as household
s that are escaping poverty over time, are more likely to be headed by a
 male.
 For the other categories, we do not find big differences between male-
 and female-headed households.
 We also looked at the age of the household head.
 We find that average age of the household head is around 40 for households
 that are chronic poor or have been sliding into poverty.
 Households that have never been poor or that have moved out of poverty
 are on average about 4 years older.

 In the left panel (1), we plot boxplots for household size for each of
 the five poverty dynamics classes.
 In the right panel (2) we do the same for child dependency ratios.
 For each household we calculate the share of children under the age of
 15 within the total household and use this to plot boxplots by poverty
 dynamics category.
 We find that higher child dependency is associated with chronic poverty,
 while the nonpoor have the lowest median child dependency ratio.
 Looking at both of the charts together, the chronic poor have relatively
 large households and high dependency ratios.
 Those that are never poor have small households and low dependency ratios.
 Households that slide below the poverty threshold and those that are vulnerable
 have a surprisingly high dependency ratio given the relatively smaller
 households.
 These may be households where one of the parents has died or has left the
 household.
 Large households with a high dependency ratio also escape poverty.
 These may be households that start to benefit from the additional cheap
 labor provided by children.

For marital status of the household head, respondents could choose from
 five mutually exclusive types of marriage: married monogamously, married
 polygamously, divorced, widow or widower, and never married.
 The results are presented as a table of proportions where the rows sum
 to 1 (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Marital-status"

\end_inset

).
 This allows us to judge the fraction of the total in each type of marriage
 accounted for by each of our poverty transition groups.
 Thus, although the chronic poor account for only about 12.3 percent of the
 population, they account for almost 20 percent of individuals living in
 households where the head has never been married.
 However, at the same time, households where the head is never married are
 clearly more likely to be nonpoor, as are households where the head has
 divorced.
 We also see that widowed households are underrepresented in the nonpoor
 segment.
 In addition, households headed by widows appear to have a hard time keeping
 consumption smooth, as is evident by the large proportion classified as
 vulnerable.
 Divorced household heads have been more successful in moving out of poverty
 and are underrepresented in the group of chronic poor households.
 Polygamously married households have been less successful in escaping poverty.
 Just as widowed household heads, they seem to have a hard time keeping
 consumption smooth between the different years.

 looks at what households report to be their major source of earnings at
 the beginning of the panel.
 While in general 35.8 percent of Ugandans fall in the nonpoor category,
 only 25.7 percent of the Ugandan subsistence farmers are in the nonpoor
 subgroup.
 It seems the group of vulnerable households is disproportionately represented
 within the group of subsistence farmers.
 Subsistence farming is indeed a very risky activity, and subsistence farmers
 have few assets to insure against adverse shocks such as bad weather outcomes
 or disease.
 Individuals that are living in households that report to be engaged in
 commercial farming appear more likely to be nonpoor.
 Wage employment also seems to be an activity that is prevalent among the
 nonpoor.
 But among the wage employed, there is also an overrepresentation in the
 group of people that have fallen into poverty.

\begin_layout Standard
Ugandans engaged in nonagricultural enterprises are also likely to fall
 into the nonpoor category.
 The most clear results are for those who mention their main source of income
 is property - virtually all are nonpoor.
 People that depend on transfers are also nonpoor.
 Transfers are likely to correlate with social capital, and hence the lower
 probability that households fall into the vulnerable group or in the group
 that falls into poverty.
 Finally, a significant group of people reported to be depending on handouts.
 As expected, these are especially the chronic poor or individuals that
 are vulnerable.
 It is, however, also interesting to note that 17.2 percent of the individuals
 that report organizational support as their main source of income are never
 poor in the four-wave panel.

Education

\begin_layout Standard
In traditional poverty profiles, the education level of the household head
 is often significant.
 Indeed, skills are important for the self-employed, and schooled labor
 is likely to be better rewarded.
 It is less obvious how schooling affects poverty dynamics in the short
 run.
 Lack of education has been linked to intergenerational poverty

 Education is also among the initial characteristics associated with chronic
 poverty in rural communities in Ethiopia

 looks at the highest education level reported by the household head.
 We see that 17.6 percent of all Ugandan household heads have never attended
 school.
 However, within the group of individuals in households that have always
 been poor, the share of households that are headed by someone without formal
 education is 37 percent.
 On the other hand, the share of household with heads without schooling
 in the subgroup of the nonpoor is only 7.8 percent.
 In the second row, we see that the majority of household heads have finished
 primary eduction.
 Primary education also seems insufficient to keep the household permanently
 out of poverty.
 Everything above primary education leads to a higher-than-average chance
 to be in the nonpoor class.

Health
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Illness and health shocks have been reported to affect poverty dynamics.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "doi:10.1080/00220380500405394"

\end_inset

 note that serious human health shocks causing permanent injury or illness
 or death were among the most frequently cited reasons for households falling
 into poverty in quantitative data from Madagascar and Kenya.
 But the bidirectional nature of the poverty relationship between poverty
 and health may trap households in persistent poverty, as ill health can
 be a catalyst for poverty spirals and in turn poverty can create and perpetuate
 poor health status

\begin_layout Standard
Health status is likely to be a function of the distance the nearest health
 facility.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Distance-to-health"

\end_inset

 reports on distance to nearest health facility.
 By health facility we mean either a private clinic, a government or nongovernme
ntal health unit or hospital.
 There seems to be some pattern in the data.
 Households that are never poor in any of the waves of the panel dataset
 reported lowest median distance to health facilities.
 At the other extreme, we find that households that live in chronic poverty
 reported highest median distance to health facilities.
 Distance to health facilities likely reflects location, as we have seen
 that the chronic poor tend to live in more remote areas.

Figure

 looks at average days that household heads reported being inactive due
 to illness in the last six months in the 2005/2006 UNPS wave conditional
 on subsequent poverty transitions.
 For most of the categories, the number of days lost is on average about
 8.5 days.
 We see that people that have lost relatively few days due to illness are
 more likely to be in the subgroup that subsequently escapes poverty.
 On the other hand, the households that report the highest number of days
 lost by the household head due to illness are those that are in the subgroup
 of households that eventually fall into poverty or are living in chronic
 poverty.

Shocks and Coping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The poor are known to be more vulnerable to shocks, due to their lower ability
 to insure 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:oxp:obooks:9780199276837"

\end_inset

.
 Shocks can have lasting effects if they destroy productive assets, such
 as when droughts reduce livestock, or health shocks that destroy human
 capital.
 If households are left with too few productive assets to replenish the
 gap left by shocks, they are likely to fall into an asset-based poverty
 trap 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "doi:10.1080/00220380500405261"

\end_inset

 We also look at how the households deal with shocks ex post conditional
 on their wealth dynamics category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:shocks"

\end_inset

 look at shocks reported at the onset of the panel.
 We again report column percentages.
 Hence, while 35 percent of all shocks are drought related, this increases
 to almost 40 percent in the group of the chronic poor.
 Still, drought also features prominently in the group that subsequently
 escapes poverty.
 A substantial share of the nonpoor report to have been exposed to drought
 shocks, but this share is only about 5 percentage points lower than the
 overall share that reports drought-related shocks.
 Floods, hailstorms, and also pest reports do not seem to differ too much
 between the different groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bad seed quality is reported more among the nonpoor than average.
 This may be because especially farmers that are always above the poverty
 line are more commercially oriented and buy seed, instead of recycling
 seeds.
 As such, they are also more prone to counterfeit seeds.
 But probably the most significant result in this table is the disproportionate
 number of people within chronically poor households that report being affected
 by civil strife.
 Poverty that is associated with civil war seems to be very persistent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:eee:wdevel:v:31:y:2003:i:3:p:629-646"

\end_inset

.
 The nonpoor clearly faced different shocks.
 They report more than average losses related to robbery and theft.
 This category also shows up relatively more in the category of households
 that slide into poverty.
 The death of a family member is also disproportionately mentioned among
 those that fall into poverty over the period covered by the panel.

Finally, the dot chart in figure

 shows how the different categories of households reportedly dealt with
 shocks.
 The top of the chart shows that the nonpoor most often used savings to
 cope with shocks.
 This is also reported as a main source of expost insurance for a substantial
 part that have slid into poverty over the course of the panel.
 The chronic poor deal in a completely different way with shocks.
 For instance, they can not rely on savings to deal with shocks.
 Instead, the poor seem to rely on employment and migration, but most of
 all simply have no choice but to reduce consumption.
 The graph also shows the importance of social capital to deal with shocks
 for vulnerable households.
 There is also some indication that informal borrowing during the first
 round of our panel is associated to an increase in the chance that households
 descend into poverty.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we reassess the evolution of poverty over the past 10 years
 in Uganda.
 Official figures suggest substantial poverty reduction, but independent
 researchers note that the benefits of economic growth have been shared
 unequally.
 In addition, casual observation does not correspond to the rosy picture
 that official figures suggest.
 Other indicators that define well-being in a broader way, such as adult
 literacy and maternal health, also put Uganda at a much lower level than
 what would correspond to the disseminated poverty levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible explanation for this divergence lies in the poverty line.
 The poverty line that is currently in use to estimate official poverty
 in Uganda was constructed more than a decade ago, using data from a 1993/1994
 survey.
 In addition, this poverty line relies on a single food consumption basket
 for Uganda, despite the fact that Uganda consists of a diverse set of regions,
 each with their own diets.
 These diets are also exceptional in their difference in cost to obtain
 a certain level of kilocalories (or utility of that matter).
 Lumping all regions together and assuming they require the same amounts
 of each commodity disregards the cultural and agroclimatic diversity that
 typifies Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We therefore follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:58:y:2010:i:3:p:449-474"

\end_inset

, who propose an information-theoretic approach to constructing utility-consiste
nt poverty lines.
 The idea is to construct different poverty lines by spatial (or temporal)
 domain that yield a minimal amount of kilocalories given the demographic
 makeup of the region.
 These poverty lines are then tested to check if they obey revealed preference
 conditions.
 In particular, we check if the food baskets chosen in all other regions
 are less expensive than the food basket chosen in a particular region.
 If not, the individual could have chosen a cheaper basket that yields the
 same utility.
 This violates the revealed preference condition.
 We apply an information-theoretic approach that adjusts consumption shares
 such that this revealed preference condition is satisfied, while keeping
 the original diets intact as much as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We feel that the poverty estimates using poverty lines that reflect local
 diets are more realistic than the official ones.
 For instance, they are much more in line with the levels and evolution
 of other non-monetary poverty indicators.
 A case in point is the nutritional status of children.
 According to the Uganda Demographic Household Survey 2011, height-for-age
 scores are worst in the Western region, except for the Karamoja district.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 also find that the highest rates of stunting are in the southwestern subregion.
 This at least indicates that the situation in terms of poverty is less
 rosy than official figures suggest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While our analysis shows the situation has improved over time in the Northern
 region, a disturbingly large proportion of the chronic poor remain.
 In addition, a substantial proportion of vulnerable households resides
 in the Northern region.
 The use of utility-consistent poverty lines that are allowed to differ
 in terms of diet by geographic location also points to substantial poverty
 in the Western region.
 The fact that in this region, relatively few households are escaping poverty
 and relatively more households are falling into poverty needs attention.
 This is in stark contrast to the Central region, where, despite the already
 high presence of nonpoor, many poor households have escaped poverty over
 time and very few households have slipped back into poverty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to household demographics, we find that chronic poor households
 are more likely to be headed by a female.
 In addition, households that were never poor in our panel are more likely
 to be headed by a male.
 Higher child dependency is associated with chronic poverty, while the nonpoor
 have the lowest median child dependency ratio.
 Despite the relatively low household size, it now seems that the households
 that slide below the poverty threshold have a surprisingly high dependency
 ratio.
 These may be households where one of the parents has died or has left the
 household.
 We also see that widowed households are underrepresented in the nonpoor
 segment.
 In addition, households headed by widows appear to have a hard time keeping
 consumption smooth, as is evident by the large proportion classified as
 vulnerable.
 Households where the head is never married are clearly more likely to be
 nonpoor.
 Divorced household heads have been more successful in moving out of poverty,
 and they are also more likely to be nonpoor.
 Polygamously married households have been disproportionately sliding into
 poverty and are also slightly more likely to be chronic poor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we look at the main source of income at the start of the panel, we find
 a significant group of people that reported to be depending on handouts.
 As expected, these are especially the chronic poor or individuals that
 fall into poverty.
 It seems the group of vulnerable households is disproportionately represented
 within the group of subsistence farmers, underlining the riskiness of rainfed
 agriculture.
 Ugandans engaged in commercial agriculture of nonagricultural enterprises
 are also likely to fall into the nonpoor category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at education and health.
 We find that households that live in chronic poverty reported highest median
 distance to health facilities.
 Distance to health facilities likely reflects location, as we have seen
 that the chronic poor tend to live in more remote areas.
 Another striking feature is that long periods of illness (in terms of days
 lost due to illness) are correlated with sliding into poverty.
 Primary education of the household head alone also seems insufficient to
 escape poverty in the long run.
 Finally, we find some interesting results with respect to shocks and how
 households subsequently deal with these shocks.
 While the chronic poor have no other option than to reduce consumption,
 the nonpoor draw on savings.
 Social networks also seem important for vulnerable households.
