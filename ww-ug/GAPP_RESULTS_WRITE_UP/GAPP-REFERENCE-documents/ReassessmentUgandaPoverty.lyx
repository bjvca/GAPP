\begin_layout Abstract
Uganda has seen substantial poverty reduction, but reported measures are
 flawed because the official poverty line is based on a single national
 food poverty line that was constructed using 1993 data.
 We use regional consumption patterns to construct poverty lines that account
 for location specific diets and adjust these poverty lines such that they
 pass revealed preference tests.
 In doing so, we estimate poverty in Uganda using the 2005/06 and 2009/10
 Uganda National Household Survey and the 2010/11 round of the Uganda National
 Panel Survey.
 We find poverty to be higher in general, and reductions in poverty were
 slower than official figures suggest.
 We also find that poverty is highest in regions that consume relatively
 more matooke, while the North seems to enjoy cheap calories, making them
 less poor than officially reported.
 However, the figure from the North hides significant heterogeneity, and
 poverty reduction in the North is very slow.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the past few decades, Uganda has seen substantial economic growth.
 Since 1986, when the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took over government,
 real GDP has grown at an annual rate of 6.8, making it one of the fastest
 growing economies in Africa.
 This growth has been attributed to the new government that has implemented
 a far-reaching economic reform agenda, transforming Uganda into one of
 the most liberal economies in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 With the liberalization of the exchange and trade regime, the abolition
 of the Industrial Licensing Act, the promulgation of a new investment code,
 and the gradual liberalization of agricultural pricing and marketing, the
 government has put in place some of the essential pre-conditions for sustainabl
e growth

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This growth has been accompanied by equally impressive declines in the levels
 of poverty as reported by the government.
 While aggregate headcount poverty stood at about 57 percent in the early
 1990s, the most recent estimate puts 24 percent of the population below
 the official poverty line.
 But despite these successes at the aggregate level, researchers warn that
 this growth has not been shared equally by the population at large.
 Marked spatial heterogeneity in baseline poverty and subsequent poverty
 reductions mean differences in the standard of living between locations
 are much higher now then what they used to be.
 In addition, some argue that the official poverty measures are too high
 if they are compared to non-monetary indicators and qualitative data from
 other countries.
 These observations have raised suspicion about the poverty lines used by
 the government of Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In light of this, we will reassess poverty in Uganda paying particular attention
 to spatial aspects in the construction of poverty lines.
 Uganda has been using the same Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) basket for over
 two decades now.
 In addition, this consumption basket is the same for the entire Ugandan
 population.
 However, it is well known that Uganda has an unusually large regional variation
 in diets within the country, with no less than six major food staples being
 eaten 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:12:y:2003:i:4:p:598-624"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, matooke, or cooking bananas, is mainly eaten in the West,
 and to a lesser extend in Central region.
 Households living in the dryer North, however, obtain a substantial share
 of their calories through sorghum and sesame.
 These diets are not only determined by custom, they are also related to
 the agro-geological characteristics.
 For instance, the dryer North is more suited for cassava than matooke,
 and the low value to weight ratio typical of staple foods essentially renders
 them non-tradables.
 If these different diets result in different costs to obtain basic needs,
 this should be accommodated in the poverty measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, we will estimate at poverty at three distinct points
 in time during the last decennium in Uganda.
 To account for differences in consumption patters, we will construct regional
 poverty lines.
 For each of the four regions, we construct a food basket that produces
 a certain minimum of calories that reflects the diets of the poorest households
 in that region.
 These baskets are then multiplied by prices prevailing in that region to
 come to food poverty lines.
 An allowance for basic non-food necessities is than added to get four regional
 poverty lines.
 We then test these four poverty lines to see if they are utility consistent.
 The idea is that a basic needs bundle in a certain region A should always
 be cheaper than a bundle from any other region valued at prices of region
 A.
 If a bundle does not satisfy these revealed preference conditions, we use
 an information theoretic approach to adjust the bundles until they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
 We first give an overview of poverty in the previous millennium and look
 at the present official poverty estimates.
 In section 3, we briefly explain the reasoning behind the use of regional
 poverty lines and the role of revealed preferences when constructing them.
 Section 4 presents our poverty estimates and compares them to poverty figures
 found in other studies.
 Section 5 concludes.

Poverty in Uganda - Trends and Controversies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a substantial literature on poverty and its dynamics in the 1990s.
 This is due to the fact that there is relatively high quality data available
 for this period.
 Uganda has been conducting national household surveys since 1992, and has
 conducted six such surveys before the turn of the millennium.
 Some of these data sets form a panel.
 The fist data set, the Integrated Household Survey conducted in 1992-3
 can be linked to the last survey of the millennium, referred to as the
 first Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS 1999-0).
 In between these two surveys, a series four of Monitoring Surveys (1993-4
 up to 1999-0) have been carried out.
 More information on these data sets can be found in

, presents official headcount poverty rates before the year 2000.
 As can be seen, poverty decreased substantially, falling by almost 40 percent
 at the national level.
 However, this table also shows significant spatial differences in both
 levels and changes in poverty.
 The urban areas and Central region reduce poverty fastest.
 The Northern region, already starting from high levels of poverty, are
 relatively unsuccessful in bringing down the number of people living below
 the poverty line.
 In addition, studies that exploit the panel nature of the data find that
 in some regions, poverty is particularly persistent

 argue that Uganda is unusual in that different regions have very different
 diets.
 This may not matter very much if the diets are equally cost effective in
 obtaining basic needs.
 However, the staple food of choice of a large part of the population, both
 in the West and the Central region, is matooke, a is highly localized staple.
 Matooke appears to be a very expensive source of calories, compared to
 what people in for instance the North consume.
 When they account for this in their analysis, they come to the conclusion
 that poverty is much more pronounced in the Western region then in the
 North.
 Even after correcting for income difference, as regions that consume more
 expensive calories may do so simply because they have higher incomes,

 shows that poverty at the national level kept falling at the same rate.
 At the same time, differential progress in poverty reduction in different
 regions leads to higher poverty differences between regions by 2009/10.
 For instance, by 2009/10, poverty is more than four times higher in the
 Northern region than in the Central region.
 In 2002/03, the North was 2.7 times poorer than the Central Region.

 uses Demographic and Health Survey Data and methods related to poverty
 mapping and small area estimation to look at poverty trends across Uganda
 from 1995 to 2010.
 She uses the 2005/06 UNHS survey to estimate regressions that correlate
 poverty to a series of household characteristics that also appear in the
 DHS (four such surveys have been carried out between 1995 and 2009/10).
 She then uses the DHS surveys to predict poverty in each of the DHS survey
 years.
 She finds that poverty indeed reduced over time, but much slower than official
 figures suggest.
 While her national estimate of headcount poverty in 2006 is 33% and thus
 very close to the official estimate of 2005/6, the rates still stands as
 30 percent using the 2009 DHS, about 6 percentage points higher then the
 2009/10 UNHS estimate.

 admits that qualitative findings on poverty trends suggest there was a
 decrease in well-being despite the drop in poverty rates.
 Recently, an unpublished manuscript has been circulating that compares
 Uganda to other African countries on six non-monetary poverty indicators,
 such as literacy rates and access to piped water.
 This admittedly partial analysis also points to a much higher incidence
 of poverty.

Utility Consistent Poverty Lines using Revealed Preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main weaknesses of the official poverty measures is the fact
 that it is based on a poverty line that is constructed using a single food
 commodity bundle for the entire region.
 In addition, this food basket has been constructed in 1993 and has not
 been updated since, apart from simple inflation by the consumption price
 index.
 However, it is well known that in many instances - for example, if relative
 prices of basic commodities vary by region (or through time) and preferences
 permit substitution - the use of a single consumption bundle may yield
 inconsistent poverty comparisons

.
 While difference in prices in different locations have always been incorporated
 by adjusting local prices to the prices used in the construction of the
 poverty line, it becomes more and more common to also account for spatial
 heterogeneity in consumption bundles (eg.

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While differences in consumption baskets are interesting in its own right,
 they only become relevant in the context of poverty measurement and analysis
 when we evaluate the cost of these basic need.
 Indeed, what matters for poverty comparisons is that different diets may
 provide the same basic needs (usually a given amount of kilo-calories per
 day per adult equivalent) at significantly different cost.
 It is especially in this regard that Uganda is an interesting case.
 Matooke, the main ingredient in the diet of households in the West is a
 very expensive source of food energy, almost three times as expensive as
 sorghum that is consumed in the North.
 As such, to compare the West to the North on the basis of the same daily
 nutritional requirements, the West will need a much higher poverty line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how can we be sure that two different consumption bundles provide the
 same basic needs? Or, in the language of

? CBN poverty lines can be viewed as the expenditure needed to acquire a
 specific bundle of goods.
 Different CBN poverty lines will be utility consistent if the underlying
 bundles of goods are on the Hicksian utility-compensated demand functions
 and hence yield the same level of utility.
 But this only passes the question down.
 How can we be sure the underlying bundles yield the same utility? As

 argue, the theory of revealed preferences provides a framework for countering
 these difficulties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea uses the rationality assumption that economic agent that derive
 utility from consumption always preferred consuming more to less.
 Let us assume that a representative agent living in spatial domain 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(r\in R)$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
derives utility from a set of consumption goods (
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

).
 We will then instruct each representative consumer in each spatial domain
 
\emph on
r 
\emph default
to spend a minimum to attain an arbitrary (but constant across spatial domains)
 level of utility.
 As such, each individual will spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 on a consumption bundle, with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the price of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the price of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
.
 Revealed preference conditions will then imply that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum p_{i,r}q_{ir'}\geq\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}\;\forall r,r'\label{eq:revpref}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is so because the representative consumer in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 will choose only that bundle that minimizes expenditure.
 Thus, any other bundle that yields the same level of utility (such as for
 instance the one chosen by the representative consumer in region 
\emph on
r'
\emph default
) should be equally or more expensive than the chosen bundle.
 There can be no bundle that costs less than the chosen one yet yields that
 same utility, because then the rational consumer should have chosen that
 one.
 The above condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:revpref"

\end_inset

 should hold for all possible pairs of spatial domains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, however, it will be hard to construct a set of poverty lines
 that meet revealed preference conditions for all possible pairs of spatial
 domains.
 We use a minimum cross-entropy approach to adjust expenditure shares such
 that they meet revealed preference conditions.
 This approach uses the expenditure shares of the original bundles as prior
 information (in the form of probabilities that an arbitrarily small amount
 of money will be devoted to the purchase of the particular good) and the
 revealed preference conditions as constraints on the values that the parameters
 can take.
 The end result will be a set of adjusted expenditure shares that are as
 closely as possible to the original shares, yet that obey a minimal set
 of conditions such that the estimated bundles are consistent with some
 arbitrary unknown preference set

A Reassessment of Poverty in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will look at data taken from thee different surveys.
 The oldest is the Uganda National Household Survey conducted in 2005/06.
 The second is the Uganda National Household survey conducted in 2009/10.
 Finally, we will also run the analysis on the second wave of the Uganda
 National Panel Survey (2010/11).
 Unfortunately, this last survey is much smaller than the previous surveys,
 so this survey is designed to be representative only up to the regional
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each data set, we will start by constructing new food bundles in each
 spatial domain.
 For Uganda, we will use the four regions as spatial domains.
 In each poverty line region, a basket of food products that satisfied basic
 calorie needs (WHO 1985)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 was identified using information on the age and sex composition of the
 household and the recorded consumption patterns of poorer households.
 The cost of this basket, valued at prices prevailing within each region,
 is the food poverty line in each region.
 A nonfood poverty line was obtained for each region by calculating the
 share of food expenditures for households whose total food and nonfood
 consumption per capita was near the food poverty line.
 The total poverty line is obtained as the sum of the food and the nonfood
 poverty lines.
 Finally, if the bundles do not satisfy revealed preference tests, we adjust
 expenditure shares until they do using the entropy approach outlined above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be instructive to have a closer look at the poverty lines.
 After all, poverty lines are not only useful to separate the rich from
 the poor,or but also as cost-of-living indexes, permitting interpersonal
 welfare comparisons when the cost of acquiring basic needs varies over
 time or space

 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Evolution-of-cost"

\end_inset

 shows that the cost to satisfy basic needs is the highest in the Central
 region and lowest in the Northern region.
 The fact that Northern region has the lowest cost of basic needs is due
 to the fact that the diet in this region consists mainly of sweet potatoes,
 cassava, sorghum and sesame.
 These four commodities are cheap sources of calories.
 Both sweet potatoes and cassava cost only 0.088 shillings per kilo-calorie.
 Sorghum costs 0.064 and sesame only 0.037 shillings per kg.
 In the West, and to a lesser extent in the Central region, sweet potatoes
 is eaten together with matooke (0.174 shillings per kg) and cassava.
 In the East, sweet potatoes and cassava is supplemented with maize (0.128)
 and millet (0.143).

We can also compare our poverty lines to the official poverty lines.
 As said before, official poverty lines are based on a single food basket,
 derived from the 1993/1994 data.
 In particular, the a food basket was identified with 28 of the most frequently
 consumed food items by households with less than the median income.
 These food items were then converted into their caloric equivalent and
 scaled to generate 3000 calories per adult equivalent day using as reference
 the WHO estimates for an 18‐30 year old male.
 Next, a non-food allowance is added.
 Non‐food requirements are estimated as the average non‐food expenditure
 of those households whose total expenditure is just equal to the food poverty
 line.
 The non-food allowance does allow for spatial heterogeneity, as separate
 averages are calculated for urban/rural location interacted with the four
 regions.
 This is a conservative estimate of the poverty line, as one could also
 opt to estimate the average non-food expenditure of those households with
 food expenditure equal to the food poverty line.
 Official poverty lines for the 2005/06 and 2009/10 surveys are presented

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing the official poverty lines to the utility consistent poverty lines
 underscores the importance of the cost of diets in different regions to
 attain a certain amount of kilo-calories.
 The most striking case is again the North.
 According to official estimates, it will cost a person UGX700 to obtain
 his/her daily calorie requirements.
 However, if we allow this person to have his/her own specific regional
 diet, he/she will extract energy from staples that are potentially more
 or less cost effective in obtaining basic needs.
 In the North, this results in much higher shares of cassava, sorghum and
 sim-sim (sesame), all crops that are relatively cheap in obtaining a given
 amount of kilo-calories.
 In 2005/06, the cost of basic needs of an individual for one day in the
 North appears to be less then half of the official cost once we take into
 account this region specific diet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reverse holds for the Central and the Western region.
 There, the cost of meeting basic needs of an individual increases if we
 allow them to assemble their own diet.
 This is as expected, as these regions rely heavily on matooke, the most
 expensive staple
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Irish potatoes and rices are even less cost effective than matooke, but
 these crops are rarely consumed in Uganda, especially in rural Uganda.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The official poverty line that relies on a single consumption basket for
 the entire country therefor averages out this expensive diet over the entire
 country.
 The Eastern region, where cassava and sweet potatoes is supplemented with
 maize, the utility consistent poverty line is slightly lower than the official
 line in 2005/06.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also interesting to look at the evolution over time.
 For the official poverty line, the consumption bundle has simply been re-weight
ed by the food prices that prevail in 2009/10.
 Then the non-food allowance is re-estimated using the method presented
 above.
 This means that the increase in the cost of living is largely the same
 in each region, about UGX300.
 The only exception is Central, which is heavily urbanized and included
 Kampala.
 The story is different when using revealed preferences.
 The cost of living changes little in the West, reflecting the fact that
 matooke is a very localized commodity whose price evolved somewhat independent
 from the food prices of other staples that surged during 2008/09.
 The Central region saw a more than UGX500 increase in the cost of living.
 This is partly due to the fact that prices have increased more in urban
 areas during the 2008/09 food price crisis.
 Also in the North, there was a doubling of the cost of basic needs.
 The sharp increase in prices also mean that households are devoting significant
ly larger shares to food.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 reports poverty measures based on the regionally differentiated poverty
 lines using the FGT index

.
 We have aggregated the measures at the national, the rural/urban and the
 regional level for all surveys.
 We have added the district level for the UNHS surveys.
 Unfortunately, the UNPS 2010/11 is only representative up to the regional
 level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the national level, we find that poverty stood at about 38 percent in
 2005/06, about 7 percentage points higher than the official figure.
 Over time, poverty has decreased, but slower than what official poverty
 figures suggest.
 For instance, between 2005/06 and 2009/10, official headcount poverty fell
 by about 23 percent.
 Our estimates suggest the reduction over that period was only 5 percent.
 But in 2010/11, a substantial poverty reduction is registered, bringing
 the reduction over this larger time span closer to the official estimates.
 It is easy to see why we find this pattern.
 A cost of basic needs approach rooted in regional caloric requirements
 and differentiated consumption bundles would be expected to shift poverty
 lines upward if prices of commodities increase.
 Our poverty measure is likely to better reflect the impact of the food
 price crisis than the national poverty measure based on (consumer price
 index adjusted) poverty lines.
 This explanation is supported by the fact that poverty increases for the
 urban poor (from 13 to 16.3 percent) between 2005/06 and 2009/10, and the
 poorest of the poor (the North Eastern province), two groups that are likely
 to be especially hit by food price surges 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we aggregate by region, we find that, in 2005/06, poverty is lowest in
 the Northern region, a region that has always been regarded as the poorest
 in Uganda (see table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Official-poverty-headcount00s"

\end_inset

).
 However, these figures mask significant heterogeneity in the North.
 Despite the fact that the North as a region is not ranked as the poorest
 region, we find nevertheless that North East is consistently ranked as
 the poorest province.
 The North East is also know as the Karamajong region, a dry and conflict
 prone area inhabited by a nomadic people that rely on livestock herding
 as their main livelihood activity.
 It is well know that these people are among the most marginalized groups
 in Uganda and vulnerable to frequent food and and water shortages.
 In addition, the Northern region is also the only one where poverty seems
 to be on the rise over time.
 This fact corresponds to the feeling that the North has been neglected,
 or at best, that the North has not benefited much from government policies
 to eradicate growth.
 A last contributing factor to the pattern may be due to sampling bias.
 Conflicts in the North meant that, often, substantial parts of the area
 were not included in the survey.
 Since conflict affected area are likely to be poorer, leaving them out
 will bias poverty downward.
 When stability returned around 2006, subsequent surveys added areas that
 were previously affected by conflict, sharply increasing headcount poverty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find that the Western region was the poorest in 2005/06 and in 2010/11.
 It was briefly surpassed by the Eastern region during the food price crisis.
 Indeed, as we mentioned before, the price of matooke did not increase as
 much as the price of other commodities, due to its localized nature.
 Our results are consistent with the analysis of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "New1"

 and

.
 They both argue that a single consumption basket can not represent the
 varied diets Ugandans in different parts of the country enjoy.
 They therefore construct poverty lines that are different by spatial domains,
 much as what we have been doing here.
 Their conclusion is in line with our conclusion.
 Due to the fact that Northerners consume much more calorie efficient staple
 foods (such as cassava and sorghum), their cost of basic needs is lower,
 leading to a lower poverty line than the national one.
 In contrast, in the Western region, people tend to rely much more on matooke,
 which is a very expensive source of calories.
 They both conclude that, when using region specific cost of basic needs
 poverty lines, the Western Region was the poorest in the 1990s.

\begin_layout Standard
We already made the case above that poverty measures based on region specific
 and utility consistent poverty lines are to be preferred to poverty lines
 based on a single consumption basket from a theoretical point of view.
 In addition, there is widespread skepticism amongst researchers and observers
 about the official poverty figures disclosed by the government.
 Our estimates are closer to what qualitative data suggests, and are also
 in line with studies by independent researchers, such as

 and

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we re-assess the evolution of poverty over the past 10 years
 in Uganda.
 Official figures suggest substantial poverty reduction, but independent
 researchers note that the benefits of economic growth have been shared
 unequally.
 In addition, casual observation does not correspond to the rosy picture
 that official figures suggest.
 Other indicators that define well being in a broader way, such as adult
 literacy and maternal health, also put Uganda at a much lower level than
 what would correspond to the disseminated poverty levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible explanation for this divergence lies in the poverty line.
 The poverty line that is currently in use to estimate official poverty
 in Uganda has been constructed over a decade ago, using data from a 1993/1994
 survey.
 In addition, this poverty line relies on a single food consumption basket
 for Uganda, despite the fact that Uganda consists of a diverse set of regions,
 each with their own diets.
 These diets are also exceptional in their difference in cost to obtain
 a certain level of kilo-calories (or utility of that matter).
 Lumping all regions together and assuming they require the same amounts
 of each commodity disregards the cultural and agro-climatic diversity that
 typifies Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We therefore follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:58:y:2010:i:3:p:449-474"

\end_inset

, who propose an information-theoretic approach to constructing utility
 consistent poverty lines.
 The idea is to construct different poverty lines by spatial (or temporal)
 domain that yield a minimal amount of kilo-calories given the demographic
 make-up of the region.
 These poverty lines are then tested to check if obey revealed preference
 conditions.
 In particular, we check if the food baskets chosen in all other regions
 are less expensive than the food basket chosen in a particular region.
 If not, the individual could have chosen a cheaper basket that yields the
 same utility.
 This violates the revealed preference condition.
 We apply an information-theoretic approach that adjusts consumption shares
 such that this revealed preference condition is satisfied, while keeping
 the original diets in tact as much as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applying the above to three nationally representative surveys for Uganda,
 we find that national poverty has been and remains higher than the official
 figures suggest.
 Also somewhat controversial, we find that not the North, but the West is
 the region that is poorest.
 This can be re-conciliated by the fact that households living in the West
 are disproportionally dependent on matooke for their caloric requirements,
 while the North prefers (or has to rely on because of climatic conditions)
 cassava and sorghum.
 Matooke is at least twice as expensive as cassava, and three times as expensive
 as sorghum to obtain a given amount of kilo-calories.
 This results in a much lower poverty line for the North then the one for
 the West.
 Still, digging deeper, we find that the figure for the North still veils
 quite some differences.
 The karamajong region in the North remains the poorest of all districts.
