\begin_layout Abstract
Official poverty figures in Uganda, and especially the evolution of these
 figures over time, has created some controversy.
 In the paper, we tackle two issues that potentially threaten the validity
 of official poverty figures in Uganda.
 First, we estimate a new set of poverty lines that accounts for the widely
 divergent diets throughout the country.
 Second, using this new set of poverty lines, we look at poverty dynamics
 using four waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey, making sure our welfare
 indicator is defined consistently over time.
 We then classify households into categories depending on their change in
 poverty status over time and relate this to characteristics that are likely
 to change only slowly.
 This enables us to explore what characteristics are associated to, for
 instance, households that grow out of poverty and what characteristics
 are related to households that appear to be trapped in poverty.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the past few decades, Uganda has seen substantial economic growth.
 Since 1986, when the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took over government,
 real GDP has grown at an annual rate of 6.8, making it one of the fastest
 growing economies in Africa.
 This growth has been attributed to the new government that has implemented
 a far-reaching economic reforms agenda, transforming Uganda into one of
 the most liberal economies in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 With the liberalization of the exchange and trade regime, the abolition
 of the Industrial Licensing Act, the promulgation of a new investment code,
 and the gradual liberalization of agricultural pricing and marketing, the
 government has put in place some of what is thought to be the essential
 pre-conditions for sustainable economic growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This growth has been accompanied by equally impressive declines in the levels
 of poverty as reported by the government.
 While aggregate headcount poverty stood at about 57 percent in the early
 1990s, the most recent official estimate puts 19.5 percent of the population
 below the official poverty line
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the most recent official estimate, we take the poverty estimate based
 on the 2012/13 Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS).
 The data on which these estimates are based were obtained from the Uganda
 Bureau of Statistics (UBOS).
 The dataset came with a welfare aggregate based on consumption expenditure
 and a set of official poverty lines.
 Using these, we estimate national headcount poverty to be 19.5 percent.
 Official poverty estimates at the time of the UNHS 2012/13 dissemination
 and reported in the press are slightly higher (22.1 percent).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 But despite these successes at the aggregate level, researchers warn that
 this growth has not been shared equally by the population at large.
 Marked spatial heterogeneity in baseline poverty and subsequent poverty
 reductions mean differences in the standard of living between locations
 are often much higher now than what they used to be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, concern has been raised about the validity of the reported figures.
 Some argue that the lack of progress on assets accumulation and non-monetary
 well-being proxies suggest much more modest poverty reductions, raising
 suspicion about the poverty lines and the welfare indicator used by the
 government of Uganda 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "New10"

\end_inset

.
 Some scholars have also been questioning the spatial pattern of poverty
 as reported in official documents.
 This is a technical artifact of the fact that Uganda has been using the
 same Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) basket for over two decades now, with a
 food component that is the same for the entire Ugandan population.
 However, it is well known that Uganda has an unusually large regional variation
 in diets within the country, with no less than six major food staples being
 eaten 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:12:y:2003:i:4:p:598-624"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, matooke, or cooking bananas, is mainly eaten in the West,
 and to a lesser extent in Central region.
 Households living in the dryer North, however, obtain a substantial share
 of their calories through sorghum and sesame.
 These diets are not only determined by custom, they are also related to
 the agro-geological characteristics.
 The dryer North is more suited for cassava than matooke, and the low value
 to weight ratio typical of staple foods essentially renders them de-facto
 non-tradables.
 If these different diets result in different costs to obtain basic needs,
 this should be accommodated in the poverty measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we want to update existing knowledge about the state of poverty
 in Uganda, while addressing at the same time two potential problems with
 the official figures that have been identified in recent studies.
 First, to account for differences in consumption patterns, we will construct
 different poverty thresholds in different spatial domains (eg.
 in different regions), following the method developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:58:y:2010:i:3:p:449-474"

\end_inset

 to estimate utility consistent poverty lines using the latest available
 nationally representative household survey (UNHS2012/13).
 For each spatial domain, we construct a food basket that produces a certain
 minimum of calories that reflects the diets of the poorest households in
 that region.
 These baskets are then multiplied by prices prevailing in that region to
 arrive at food poverty lines.
 An allowance for basic non-food necessities is than added to get a set
 of Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) poverty lines, one in each spatial domain.
 We then test these poverty lines to see if they are utility consistent.
 The idea is that a basic needs bundle in a certain spatial domain A should
 always be cheaper than a bundle from any other region valued at prices
 of region A.
 If a bundle does not satisfy these revealed preference conditions, we use
 an information theoretic approach to adjust the bundles until they do.
 Second, we will use the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) to assure consisten
cy in the calculation of the welfare indicator.
 The UNPS is a yearly panel survey collected by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics
 (UBOS) supported by the World Bank's Living Standard Measurement Study
 (LSMS) project that tracks about 3000 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While comparing poverty estimates using these new poverty lines and a consistent
 underlying wellbeing indicator to the official estimates is interesting
 in its own right, we can also use the panel nature of the data to look
 at poverty dynamics.
 For instance, we can study how many households are chronically poor and
 investigate how their characteristics differ from other groups, such as
 households that successfully grew out of poverty.
 In other words, we will construct a detailed poverty profile that takes
 dynamic aspects into account, defining groups based on poverty transitions
 instead of on a simple dichotomous poor/non-poor status 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Boateng01031992"

\end_inset

.
 For the characteristics we contrast within each group, we confine ourselves
 to characteristics that change only slowly over time, and we look at the
 initial conditions at the start of the panel.
 We hope that this can enlighten us on the pre-conditions that need to be
 in place to be in a particular poverty dynamics group
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, we could check if households that are always below the poverty
 line are different in terms of their ability to cope with adverse shocks
 than those that grow out of poverty over the course of the panel.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
 We first give an overview of poverty in the past few decades and look at
 the present official poverty estimates in Uganda.
 We also present some studies that point to shortcomings in official poverty
 measurement.
 In section 3, we briefly explain the reasoning behind the use of regional
 poverty lines and the role of revealed preferences to test for utility
 consistency.
 Section 4 presents our poverty estimates and compares them to poverty figures
 found in other studies.
 Section 5 then looks at poverty dynamics and relates households with differing
 poverty dynamics to a selection of characteristics.
 A final section concludes.

Poverty in Uganda - Trends and Controversies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the nineties, poverty decreased substantially, falling by almost 40 percent
 at the national level in Uganda.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a substantial literature on poverty and its dynamics in the 1990s.
 This is due to the fact that there is relatively high quality data available
 for this period.
 Uganda has been conducting national household surveys since 1992, and has
 conducted six such surveys before the turn of the millennium.
 Some of these data sets form a panel.
 The first data set, the Integrated Household Survey conducted in 1992/93
 can be linked to the last survey of the millennium, referred to as the
 first Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS 1999/00).
 In between these two surveys, a series four Monitoring Surveys (1993/94
 up to 1997/98) have been carried out.
 More information on these data sets can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, this table also shows significant spatial differences in both
 levels and changes in poverty.
 The urban areas and Central region reduce poverty fastest.
 The Northern region, already starting from high levels of poverty, is relativel
y unsuccessful in bringing down the number of people living below the poverty
 line.
 In addition, studies that exploit the panel nature of the data find that
 in some regions, poverty is particularly persistent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DPR:DPR220"

\end_inset

.
 What is also puzzling is the sudden drop between 1997/08 and 1999/00.
 While it took 5 years for poverty to decrease by 20 percent between 1992
 and 1997, it took only 2 years to decrease another 20 percent at the turn
 of the century.
 This may be due to inconsistent underlying welfare indicator data, that
 was obtained from different surveys (the Monitoring Surveys vs the Uganda
 National Household Survey, see footnote 3).

One controversy which we will also address in this paper refers to the fact
 that the official poverty estimates are based on poverty lines that are
 rooted in a single food consumption bundle, derived from 1993/1994 data.
 In particular, the food basket was identified with 28 of the most frequently
 consumed food items by households with less than the median income.
 These food items were then converted into their caloric equivalent and
 scaled to generate 3,000 calories per adult equivalent per day using as
 reference the WHO estimates for an 18‐30 year old male.
 Next, a non-food allowance was added.
 Non‐food requirements were estimated as the average non‐food expenditure
 of those households whose total expenditure is just equal to the food poverty
 line.
 The non-food allowance does allow for spatial heterogeneity, as separate
 averages are calculated for urban/rural location interacted with the four
 regions (Central, East, North,West), using the method described in

.
 As far as we know, these poverty lines have since just been updated by
 the official inflation figures.

 argue that Uganda is unusual in that different regions have very different
 diets.
 This may not matter very much if the diets are equally cost effective in
 obtaining the same level of basic needs as defined in kilo-calories.
 However, the staple food of choice of a large part of the population, both
 in the West and the Central region, is matooke, a highly localized staple

 Matooke appears to be a very expensive source of calories, compared to
 what people in for instance the North consume.

 account for this in their analysis, they come to the conclusion that poverty
 is more pronounced in the Western region than found in official statistics.
 Even after correcting for income difference, as regions that consume more
 expensive calories may do so simply because they have higher incomes, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 comes to the conclusion that the Western region even overtakes the North
 as the poorest region using 1993 data.

Progress reported by the government of Uganda and the Uganda Bureau of Statistic
s in the first decade of the new millennium is equally impressive.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Official-poverty-headcount00s"

\end_inset

 shows that poverty at the national level kept falling during the first
 decade, shaving another 50 percent off of headcount poverty.
 At the same time, differential progress in poverty reduction in different
 regions persists in the first decade of the new millennium.
 For instance, by 2012/13, poverty is more than eight times higher in the
 Northern region than in the Central region.
 In 2002/03, the North was only 2.7 times poorer than the Central Region.
 The more disaggregate the numbers, the starker the contrasts become.
 In the North East, a semi-arid area with low rainfall inhabited by the
 Karamajong, an agro-pastoralist ethnic group, poverty remains stubbornly
 high, while in the Central and Western parts of the country, poverty is
 almost eradicated.

 mapping and small area estimation to look at poverty trends across Uganda
 from 1995 to 2010.
 They use the 2005/06 UNHS survey to estimate regressions that correlate
 poverty to a series of household characteristics that also appear in the
 DHS (four such surveys have been carried out between 1995 and 2009/10).
 They then use the DHS surveys to predict poverty in each of the DHS survey
 years.
 They find that poverty indeed reduced over time, but much slower than official
 figures suggest.
 While their national estimate of headcount poverty in 2006 is 33% and thus
 very close to the official estimate of 2005/6, the rates still stands as
 30 percent using the 2009 DHS, about 6 percentage points higher then the
 2009/10 UNHS estimate.

 admits that qualitative findings on poverty trends suggest there was a
 decrease in well-being despite the drop in poverty rates.
 Recently, an unpublished manuscript has been circulating that compares
 Uganda to other African countries on six non-monetary poverty indicators,
 such as literacy rates and access to piped water.
 This admittedly partial analysis also points to a much higher incidence
 of poverty, and raises questions about whether the poverty line has been
 increasing sufficiently to account for changes in the cost of living.

Utility Consistent Poverty Lines using Revealed Preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main weaknesses of the official poverty measures is the fact
 that it is based on a poverty line that is constructed using a single food
 commodity bundle for the entire country.
 In addition, this food basket was constructed in 1993 and has not been
 updated since, apart for simple inflation by the consumption price index.
 However, it is well known that in many instances - for example, if relative
 prices of basic commodities vary by region (or through time) and preferences
 permit substitution - the use of a single consumption bundle may yield
 inconsistent poverty comparisons

.
 While differences in prices in different locations are usually incorporated
 in poverty measurement by adjusting local prices to the prices used in
 the construction of the poverty line, it becomes more and more common to
 also account for spatial heterogeneity in consumption bundles in an effort
 to increase the 
\emph on

\emph default
 of poverty lines (e.g.

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While differences in consumption baskets are interesting in its own right,
 they only become relevant in the context of poverty measurement and analysis
 when we evaluate the cost of these basic needs.
 Indeed, what matters for poverty comparisons is that different diets may
 provide the same basic needs (usually a given amount of kilo-calories per
 day) at significantly different costs.
 It is especially in this regard that Uganda is an interesting case.
 Matooke, the main ingredient in the diet of households in the West may
 be more or less expensive per energy unit than for example sorghum that
 is consumed in the North.
 As such, to compare the West to the North on the basis of the same daily
 nutritional requirements would be wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how can we be sure that two different consumption bundles provide the
 same basic needs? Or, in the language of

? Cost of Basic Needs (CBN) poverty lines can be viewed as the expenditure
 needed to acquire a specific bundle of goods.
 Different CBN poverty lines will be utility consistent if the underlying
 bundles of goods are on the Hicksian utility-compensated demand functions
 and hence yield the same level of utility.
 But this only passes the question down.
 How can we be sure the underlying bundles yield the same utility? As

 argue, the theory of revealed preferences provides a framework for countering
 these difficulties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea uses the rationality assumption that economic agent that derive
 utility from consumption always prefer consuming more to less.
 Let us assume that a representative agent living in spatial domain 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(r\in R)$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
derives utility from a set of consumption goods (
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

).
 We will then instruct each representative consumer in each spatial domain
 
\emph on
r 
\emph default
to spend a minimum to attain an arbitrary (but constant across spatial domains)
 level of utility.
 As such, each individual will spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 on a consumption bundle, with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the price of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the quantity of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
.
 Revealed preference conditions will then imply that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum p_{i,r}q_{ir'}\geq\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}\;\forall r,r'\label{eq:revpref}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is so because the representative consumer in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 will choose only that bundle that minimizes expenditure.
 Thus, any other bundle that yields the same level of utility (such as for
 instance the one chosen by the representative consumer in region 
\emph on
r'
\emph default
) should be equally or more expensive than the chosen bundle.
 There can be no bundle that costs less than the chosen one yet yields that
 same utility, because then the rational consumer should have chosen that
 one
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Or, as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:y:2003:v:52:i:1:p:159-85"

\end_inset

, if the cost of a bundle from another domain would be cheaper if bought
 in a specific domain, this means it must have lower utility then the bundle
 in that specific domain, as otherwise the rational consumer would have
 picked the bundle from the other domain.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The above condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 should hold for all possible pairs of spatial domains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, however, it will be hard to construct a set of poverty lines
 that meet revealed preference conditions for all possible pairs of spatial
 domains.
 We use a minimum cross-entropy approach to adjust expenditure shares such
 that they meet revealed preference conditions.
 This approach uses the expenditure shares of the original bundles as prior
 information (in the form of probabilities that an arbitrarily small amount
 of money will be devoted to the purchase of the particular good) and the
 revealed preference conditions as constraints on the values that the parameters
 can take.
 The end result will be a set of adjusted expenditure shares that are as
 closely as possible to the original shares, yet that obey a minimal set
 of conditions such that the estimated bundles are consistent with some
 arbitrary unknown preference set

A Reassessment of Poverty in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this reassessment of poverty in Uganda, we will mainly work with the
 four waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS).
 The UNPS is a multi-topic panel household survey started by UBOS in 2009/10.
 However, the 2009/10 sample was essentially a subset of 3,123 households
 that were interviewed as part of the 2005/06 Uganda National Household
 Survey, a nationally representative survey that covered 6,775 households.
 As such, the first wave of the panel comprises of the UNHS data of this
 subsample of 3,123 households.
 After the second wave of 2009/10, the survey was repeated annually.
 Currently data is available for a third round, covering the 2010/11 agricultura
l year and a fourth round covering the 2011/12 agricultural year
\begin_inset Foot

 The UNPS is conducted in two visits in order to better capture agricultural
 outcomes associated with the two cropping seasons of the country.

 six months apart.

For the construction of the utility consistent poverty thresholds, however,
 we will use the 2012/13 Uganda National Household Survey.
 This is because the construction of utility consistent poverty lines requires
 a sufficiently large sample, with sufficient observations in each spatial
 domain.
 The larger dataset allows us to experiment with different degrees of spatial
 disaggregated for the domains.
 It also allows us to define poverty lines at a more disaggregated level
 than the maximum level of disaggregated for which the UNPS is deemed representa
tive

 We will look at poverty based on a national poverty line using a single
 spatial domain.
 Our most disaggregated case consists of 6 separate spatial domains (Kampala,
 Rural Central, Rural East, Rural North, Rural West and Other Urban).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More specifically, following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:58:y:2010:i:3:p:449-474"

\end_inset

, we start by constructing food bundles in each spatial domain.
 in each domain, a basket of food products that satisfied basic calorie
 needs was identified using information on the age and sex composition of
 the households and the recorded consumption patterns of poorer households

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The cost of this basket, valued at prices prevailing within each spatial
 domain, results in a set of food poverty lines, one in each spatial domain.
 Nonfood poverty lines are obtained by calculating the share of food expenditure
s for households whose total food and nonfood consumption per capita was
 near the food poverty line.
 Total poverty lines are obtained as the sum of the food and the nonfood
 poverty lines.
 These poverty lines are then compared, to make sure that they are utility
 consistent.
 In particular, we compare the cost of a bundle in one spatial domain to
 the bundles in the other spatial domains, but evaluated at the price in
 this spatial domain.
 As stated above, revealed preferences states that the cost of the bundle
 in the spatial domain should be smaller or equal to the bundles chosen
 in any other spatial domain.
 If this condition is violated, we use a minimum cross-entropy framework
 to adjust consumption shares in such a way that revealed preference conditions
 are satisfied.

It can be instructive to have a closer look at the poverty lines.
 After all, poverty lines are not only useful to separate the rich from
 the poor, but also serve as deflators for cost-of-living differences, permittin

 varies over time or space

, and is caused by the low energy content and relative high price of matooke,
 a staple mostly grown and consumed in the West.
 Households in the East, on the other hand, consume a lot of cassava, mostly
 in dried/flour form, which is only three times as costly, but more than
 8 times as nutritious.
 While the 2012/13 poverty lines are directly derived from the 2012/13 UNHS,
 the poverty lines for the other years are simply deflated using the Consumer
 Price Index.

Let us now look at the evolution of poverty during the recent past.
 We will present two sets of results.
 The first set of results, reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-1spdomain"

\end_inset

, uses only one spatial domain.
 In other words, we estimate a single national poverty line based on a single
 national food basket.
 We do this because, in a way, this would be the basis of updating the official
 poverty line, that is based on one single national consumption basket.
 Secondly, we will present results for an analysis that uses the six spatial
 domains mentioned above (Kampala, Rural Central, Rural East, Rural North,
 Rural West and Other Urban).
 This last analysis is, in our view, the furthest we can go in terms of
 specificity without stretching the limits of the data.
 The results are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-6spdomains"

\begin_layout Standard
Poverty headcounts using one spatial domain as reported in table

 are much lower than the official headcounts reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Official-poverty-headcount00s"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, the national estimate is only about half the official in
 2005/06.
 However, the reduction in poverty between 2005/06 and 2009/10 is much smaller
 than in the official figures.
 There is a substantial increase in poverty in 2010/11, but poverty returns
 to about 15 percent in 2011/12
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While part of this increase is likely caused by the increase in food prices,
 data problems provide an additional explanation.
 For instance, simple counts of how many households report consuming a particula
r commodity point to some severe problems.
 In 2010/11 only about 300 household report consuming sweet potatoes, while
 this is around 1400 in the other rounds.
 For cassava, in 2010/11 only 562 household report consumption, versus again
 about 1400 in all other rounds of the UNPS.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The national poverty headcounts are much closer to the official ones if
 we use six spatial domains (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-6spdomains"

\end_inset

), but the pattern, with a very modest decline between 2005/06 and 2009/10,
 and a sharp increase in headcount poverty in 2010/11 is similar to the
 pattern in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-1spdomain"

\end_inset

.
 While the depth of poverty follows the same trend (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-gap-2002-2012"

\end_inset

), it seems the severity of poverty does not decline over time (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-severity-2002-2012"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at urban versus rural disaggregation, the official figures show
 a much smaller difference in poverty between the two spatial domains than
 the ones calculated using a single national poverty line.
 For instance, poverty in rural areas is about 2.5 times the poverty in urban
 areas using official figures.
 Using a single poverty line, we now find that rural areas have a poverty
 headcount that is more than five times that of urban areas.
 This was to be expected, as a single poverty line that is between the rural
 and the urban poverty line will underestimate urban poverty and overestimate
 urban poverty.
 Over time, however, the urban-rural inequality also becomes more important
 in the official data, due to substantial poverty reductions in urban areas,
 even between 2009/10 and 2010/11 when rural poverty is rising.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going one step down on the spatial aggregation scale, we see a sharp increase
 in the absolute poverty figures of around 40 percent.
 This adds another possible explanation why official poverty figures might
 be too low.
 While 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "New10"

\end_inset

 argue that the original 1993 poverty lines may have increased too little
 to keep pace with inflation and that differences in the measurement of
 consumption have may contribute to the underestimation of poverty, we find
 that consumption bundle aggregation may also depress poverty figures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is more interesting is the change in the spatial pattern of poverty.
 Regionally disaggregated poverty figures preserve the same order if we
 compare the official poverty headcounts in table
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Official-poverty-headcount00s"

\end_inset

 to the poverty headcounts using one spatial domain in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Poverty-headcounts-1spdomain"

\end_inset

.
 However, taking into account differences in consumption patterns, we now
 find that, while the North remains by far the poorest region, the Western
 region now seems to be considerably poorer than the East.
 In terms of contribution to national poverty, the densely populated Western
 region now contributes almost as much as the Northern region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This finding mirrors, to some extent, what 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:12:y:2003:i:4:p:598-624"

 find.
 They also find that, using a single poverty line, the East is poorer than
 the West.
 This ordering turns around when they start using regional food basket poverty
 lines.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 goes even further and devises income adjusted regional food baskets.
 When these are used, it seems that the West is on average even poorer than
 the North.
 Our results are also more credible in the light of persistently low nutritional
 outcomes in the West

\begin_layout Section*
A Profile Based on Poverty Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will construct a profile for different categories of
 household based on the evolution of their poverty status over time.
 We will start by defining 5 different categories.
 The first category consist of households that are identified as being poor
 in all of the four waves of the UNPS.
 We will refer to these households as the 
\emph on
chronic 
\emph default
poor.
 Secondly, we will identify the households that were never poor in any of
 the waves.
 These households will be grouped in the 
\emph on
non-poor
\emph default
 group.
 Next, we delineate a group of households that are 
\emph on
escaping
\emph default
 poverty.
 These are households that are poor in all past waves, but non-poor in all
 subsequent waves
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This group comprises households that are poor in 2005/06 and non-poor in
 all subsequent rounds, those that are poor in 2005/06 and 2009/10 and non-poor
 in 2010/11 and 2011/12, and those that are poor in 2005/06, 2009/10 and
 2010/11 and non-poor in 2011/12.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A fourth group will then consist of those households that are 
\emph on
falling
\emph default
 into poverty.
 These are households that are non-poor in all past waves, but poor in all
 subsequent waves
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This group comprises households that are non-poor in 2005/06 and poor in
 all subsequent rounds, those that are non-poor in 2005/06 and 2009/10 and
 poor in 2010/11 and 2011/12, and those that are non-poor in 2005/06, 2009/10
 and 2010/11 and poor in 2011/12.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Finally, there is a rest category, where households are poor in some past
 waves and/or poor in some subsequent waves.
 These households, repeatedly moving in and out of poverty, are labeled
 as 
\emph on
vulnerable
\emph default
 in our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at poverty transitions, we find that only about 144 of the 2189
\emph on
 
\emph default
households that appear in all four waves are poor in each wave.
 This amounts to only 5.88 percent of the households being chronic poor.
 However, if we weigh these households by population weights, the number
 of chronic poor individuals increases to 6.85 percent.
 This suggests that the chronic poor are on average larger households.
 At the other extreme, we find that 1066 households or 48.70 percent of the
 households are never poor, corresponding to about 48 percent when using
 weights.
 256 households have escaped poverty and 234 have fallen into poverty, correspon
ding to 13.30 and 10.06 percent of the population, respectively.
 Finally, there is a sizable class of about 500 vulnerable households, or
 more than 20 percent of the population, that moves in or out of poverty,
 possibly multiple times, over the 4 waves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now relate these four categories of households to various household
 characteristics, to come up with a profile.
 Since we are interested in the likely causes of poverty transitions (as
 opposed to the likely consequences of poverty transitions), we will look
 at characteristics of the household at the first wave of the panel, i.e.
 in 2005/06.
 In other words, the profile will help us understand why households have
 fared differently in terms of poverty status because of a different past.
 As such, we will also concentrate on characteristics that change only slowly
 over time, as opposed to for instance crops cultivated, which may changes
 significantly from year to year.
 In a way, we want to identify the preconditions at the household level
 associated with different poverty transition trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first look at the location of households in the 5 classes in terms of
 being in urban or rural areas.
 It is well known that poverty is predominantly rural, and Uganda is no
 exception.
 96 percent of the chronic poor live in rural areas, while 21 percent of
 the non-poor are found in rural areas.
 For the other three categories, around 10 percent lives in urban areas.
 Going one step further, we look at the three groups by region.
 This is visualized in the mosaic plot in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Regional-Poverty-Dynamics"

\end_inset

.
 The figure clearly shows that chronic poverty is concentrated in the North.
 Here, 72 percent of all the chronic poor can be found.
 On the other end, the households that never experienced poverty our disproporti
onately located in the central region: more than 43 percent of the people
 that are always above the poverty threshold live here.
 But for the North, there is also good news.
 It seems a substantial part of the people that escape poverty are those
 from the North.
 This is different for the Eastern region, and to a lesser extent for the
 Western region, where relatively more people are falling back into poverty,
 and relatively less are escaping.
 Still, the North hosts a large proportion of vulnerable households as well.
 Finally, it is worth noting that, despite the already high presence of
 non-poor in the Central region, many poor households have escaped poverty
 over time and very few households have slipped back into poverty.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Household demographics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An indicator that is often central in poverty analysis and household demographic
 characteristics is female headedness.
 In general, female headed households are poorer and more vulnerable.
 This is what we also find in our data: chronic poor households are more
 likely to be headed by a female.
 In addition, household that were never poor in our panel are more likely
 to be headed by a male.
 For the other categories, we do not find big differences between male and
 female headed households.
 In other words, the gender of the head of the household does not to be
 an important correlate to poverty transitions.
 We also looked at the age of the household head.
 We find that average age of the household head is around 40 for households
 that are chronic poor or have been sliding into poverty.
 Households that have never been poor or that have moved out of poverty
 have a slightly older household head.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 gives an idea of the distribution household size and child dependency ratios
 conditional on what poverty dynamics group the households are in.
 In the left panel (1), we plot boxplots for each of the 5 poverty dynamics
 classes.
 While many studies find that household size is a good poverty indicator,
 the case is not clear cut.
 It is thought that increased competition for a given food stock reduces
 consumption.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ecj:econjl:v:105:y:1995:i:433:p:1415-34"

\end_inset

 argue that the negative correlation disappears as one takes economies of
 scale in household food consumption into account.
 In terms of production, a larger household may mean more and cheaper labour.
 But Van Campenhout (mimeo) finds that in Ugandan agricultural households,
 the reproductive tasks by the mother reduce time devoted to labour, leading
 to lower production of key food items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the right panel (2) we do the same for child dependency ratios.
 For each household we calculate the share of children under the age of
 15 within the total household and use this to plot boxplots by poverty
 dynamics category.
 Comparing the two panels, we do not see a clear pattern in (1).
 While large households seem to be more likely to be chronic poor, they
 are also more likely to escape poverty.
 At the same time, the category of households that fall into poverty has
 the lowest median household size.
 If we look at the number of children as a percentage of total household
 size, we find that higher child dependency is associated with chronic poverty,
 while the non-poor have the lowest median child dependency ratio.
 Despite the relatively low household size, it now seems that the households
 that slide below the poverty threshold have a surprisingly high dependency
 ratio.
 These may be households where one of the parents has died, or has left
 the households.

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting household characteristic is the marital status of the
 household head.
 Respondents could choose out of 5 mutually exclusive types of marriage:
 married monogamously, married polygamously, divorced, widow/widower and
 never married.
 The results are presented as a table of proportions where the rows sum
 to 1 (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Marital-status"

\end_inset

).
 This allows us to judge the fraction of the total in each type of marriage
 accounted for by each of our poverty transition groups.
 Thus, although the chronic poor account for only about 7 percent of the
 population, they account for almost 10 percent of individuals living in
 households where the head has never been married.
 However, at the same time households where the head is never married are
 clearly more likely to be non-poor, as are households where the head has
 divorced.
 We also see that widowed households are underrepresented in the non-poor
 segment.
 In addition, households headed by widows appear to have a hard time keeping
 consumption smooth, as is evident by the large proportion classified as
 vulnerable.
 Households where the head is never married are clearly more likely to be
 non-poor.
 Divorced household heads have been more successful in moving out of poverty,
 and they are also more likely to be non-poor.
 Polygamously married households have been disproportionately sliding into
 poverty and are also slightly more likely to be chronic poor.

 looks at what households report to be their major source of earnings at
 the beginning of the panel.
 While in general 48.1 percent of Ugandans fall in the non-poor category,
 only 39 percent of the Ugandan subsistence farmers reported to be non-poor.
 It seems the group of vulnerable households is disproportionately represented
 within the group of subsistence farmers.
 Subsistence farming is indeed a very risky activity and subsistence farmers
 have little assets to insure against adverse shocks such as bad weather
 outcomes or disease.
 Individuals that are living in households that report to be engaged in
 commercial farming appear to be non-poor.
 Wage employment also seems to be an activity that is prevalent among the
 non-poor.
 But among the wage employed, there is also a slight over-representation
 of vulnerable people.

\begin_layout Standard
Ugandans engaged in non-agricultural enterprises are also likely to fall
 into the non-poor category.
 The most clear results are for those who mention their main source of income
 is property, virtually all are non-poor.
 People that depend on transfers are also non-poor, or are escaping poverty
 over the next four years.
 Finally, there was a significant group of people that reported to be depending
 on hand-outs.
 As expected, these are especially the chronic poor or individuals that
 fall into poverty.
 It is, however, also interesting to note that there are some households
 that report organizational support as their main source of income while
 they are never poor in the 4 wave panel.

 provides kernel density plots for time reported to fetch drinking water
 including waiting time.
 You can see that respondents cluster their answers around 2 hours and 4
 hours.
 We find that in general, the non-poor need to spend less time fetching
 water, except maybe for some non-poor that spend about 2 hours.
 While the median is the same for both the chronic poor and the non-poor
 (60 minutes), the mean is 67 minutes for the non-poor and 73 for the poor.
 This is also illustrated by the fact that the chronic poor have higher
 densities at the extreme right of the distribution.
 The vulnerable have a high density around 2 hours.

Education
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next turn to education.
 One important variable in a poverty profile is the education level of the
 household head.
 We see that 17.6 percent of all Ugandan household heads have never attended
 school.
 However, within the group of households that are chronic poor, more than
 41 of the household heads reports never to have attended schooling.
 The majority of Ugandan households is headed by someone who finished primary
 education.
 Such households are distributed somewhat evenly over the five poverty transitio
n groups.
 We note that primary education seems insufficient to be non-poor.
 From post primary training, things start to look different.
 The proportion of household heads reporting post primary training is about
 twice the national proportion amongst the non-poor.
 About 17.7 percent report secondary education as highest education level.
 These households are likely to be non-poor, and are unlikely to be chronic
 poor.
 There are some higher educated household heads, who are also mostly non-poor.

 reports on distance to nearest health facility.
 By health facility we mean either a private clinic, a government of NGO
 health unit or hospital.
 There seems to be some pattern in the data.
 Households that are never poor in any of the waves of out panel reported
 lowest median distance to health facilities.
 At the other extreme, we find that households that live in chronic poverty
 reported highest median distance to health facilities.
 Distance to health facilities likely reflects location, as we have seen
 that the chronic poor tend to live in more remote areas.

Figure

 looks at average days that household heads reported being inactive due
 to illness in the last six month in the 2005/06 UNPS wave conditional on
 subsequent poverty transitions.
 For most of the categories, the number of days lost is on average about
 8.
 However, for households that fall into poverty, the reported number of
 days lost due to illness is much higher, at about 11.5 days.
 This underscores the long run risks associated to health shocks, and the
 role public policy can play here.

Shocks and Coping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we have a look at shocks reported at the onset of the panel.
 In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:shocks"

\end_inset

, we are again reporting column percentages.
 Hence, while 35 percent of all shocks are drought related, this increases
 to almost 40 percent in the group of the chronic poor.
 Still, drought also features prominently in the group that subsequently
 escapes poverty.
 But probably the most significant result in this table is the disproportionate
 number of people within chronically poor households that report being affected
 by civil strife.
 Poverty that is associated to civil war seems to be very persistent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-poor clearly faced different shocks.
 They are much less prone to experiencing weather related shock.
 They do, on the other hand, report more than average losses related to
 robbery and theft.
 This last category also shows up relatively more in the category of households
 that slide into poverty.
 Fire accidents are also related to vulnerability, falling into poverty
 and chronic poverty.

Finally, the dotchart in figure

 shows how the different categories of households reportedly dealt with
 shocks.
 The top of the chart shows that the non-poor most often used savings to
 cope with shocks.
 This is also reported as a main source of ex-post insurance for a substantial
 part that have slided into poverty over the course of the panel.
 The chronic poor deal in a completely different way with shocks.
 For instance, they can not rely on savings to deal with shocks.
 Instead, the poor seem to rely on employment and migration, but most of
 all simply have no choice but to reduce consumption.
 The graph also shows the importance of social capital to deal with shocks
 for vulnerable households.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we re-assess the evolution of poverty over the past 10 years
 in Uganda.
 Official figures suggest substantial poverty reduction, but independent
 researchers note that the benefits of economic growth have been shared
 unequally.
 In addition, casual observation does not correspond to the rosy picture
 that official figures suggest.
 Other indicators that define well being in a broader way, such as adult
 literacy and maternal health, also put Uganda at a much lower level than
 what would correspond to the disseminated poverty levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible explanation for this divergence lies in the poverty line.
 The poverty line that is currently in use to estimate official poverty
 in Uganda has been constructed over a decade ago, using data from a 1993/1994
 survey.
 In addition, this poverty line relies on a single food consumption basket
 for Uganda, despite the fact that Uganda consists of a diverse set of regions,
 each with their own diets.
 These diets are also exceptional in their difference in cost to obtain
 a certain level of kilo-calories (or utility of that matter).
 Lumping all regions together and assuming they require the same amounts
 of each commodity disregards the cultural and agro-climatic diversity that
 typifies Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We therefore follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:58:y:2010:i:3:p:449-474"

\end_inset

, who propose an information-theoretic approach to constructing utility
 consistent poverty lines.
 The idea is to construct different poverty lines by spatial (or temporal)
 domain that yield a minimal amount of kilo-calories given the demographic
 make-up of the region.
 These poverty lines are then tested to check if they obey revealed preference
 conditions.
 In particular, we check if the food baskets chosen in all other regions
 are less expensive than the food basket chosen in a particular region.
 If not, the individual could have chosen a cheaper basket that yields the
 same utility.
 This violates the revealed preference condition.
 We apply an information-theoretic approach that adjusts consumption shares
 such that this revealed preference condition is satisfied, while keeping
 the original diets in tact as much as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We feel that the poverty estimates using poverty lines that reflect local
 diets are more realistic than the official ones.
 For instance, they are much more consistent to other non-monetary indicators.
 A case in point is the nutritional status of children.
 According to the Uganda Demographic Household Survey 2011, height-for-age
 scores are worst in the West, except for the Karamoja region.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ags:eprcrs:113614"

\end_inset

 also finds that the highest rates of stunting are in the South-West sub-region.
 This at least indicates that the situation in terms of poverty is less
 rosy than official figures suggest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While our analysis shows the situation has improved over time in the North,
 a disturbingly large proportion of the chronic poor remain.
 In addition, there is also a substantial proportion of vulnerable household
 residing in the North.
 The use of utility consistent poverty lines that are allowed to differ
 in terms of diet by geographic location also point to substantial poverty
 in the Western region.
 The fact that in this region, relatively few households are escaping poverty
 and relatively more households are falling into poverty needs attention.
 This is in stark contrast to the Central region, where, despite the already
 high presence of non-poor, many poor households have escaped poverty over
 time and very few households have slipped back into poverty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to household demographics, we find that chronic poor households
 are more likely to be headed by a female.
 In addition, household that were never poor in our panel are more likely
 to be headed by a male.
 higher child dependency is associated with chronic poverty, while the non-poor
 have the lowest median child dependency ratio.
 Despite the relatively low household size, it now seems that the households
 that slide below the poverty threshold have a surprisingly high dependency
 ratio.
 These may be households where one of the parents has died, or has left
 the households.
 We also see that widowed households are underrepresented in the non-poor
 segment.
 In addition, households headed by widows appear to have a hard time keeping
 consumption smooth, as is evident by the large proportion classified as
 vulnerable.
 Households where the head is never married are clearly more likely to be
 non-poor.
 Divorced household heads have been more successful in moving out of poverty,
 and they are also more likely to be non-poor.
 Polygamously married households have been disproportionately sliding into
 poverty and are also slightly more likely to be chronic poor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we look at the main source of income at the start of the panel, we find
 a significant group of people that reported to be depending on hand-outs.
 As expected, these are especially the chronic poor or individuals that
 fall into poverty.
 It seems the group of vulnerable households is disproportionately represented
 within the group of subsistence farmers, underlining the riskiness of rain-fed
 agriculture.
 Ugandans engaged in commercial agriculture of non-agricultural enterprises
 are also likely to fall into the non-poor category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then look at access to services, education and health.
 We find that households that live in chronic poverty reported highest median
 distance to health facilities.
 Distance to health facilities likely reflects location, as we have seen
 that the chronic poor tend to live in more remote areas.
 Another striking feature is long periods of illness (in terms of days lost
 due to illness) are correlated with sliding into poverty.
 Primary education of the household head alone also seems insufficient to
 escape poverty in the long run.
 Finally, we find some interesting results with respect to shocks and how
 households subsequently deal with these shocks.
 While the chronic poor have no other option than to reduce consumption,
 the non-poor draw on savings.
 Social networks also seem important for vulnerable households.
