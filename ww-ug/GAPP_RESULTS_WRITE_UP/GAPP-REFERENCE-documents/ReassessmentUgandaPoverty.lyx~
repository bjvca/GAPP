\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the past few decades, Uganda has seen substantial poverty reduction.
 While part of this poverty reduction is a peace divident, the govenment's
 policies have.
 As a results, Uganda hit the Millenium Development Goal of halving poverty
 in XXXX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, the tide has been turning.
 Museveni's Uganda is quickly losing his status as donor darling.
 In the wake of these political events, more and more people also start
 questioning the continuing reduction in official poverty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda has been using the same CBN basket for over two decades now.
 In addition, this consumption basket is the same for the entire Ugandan
 population.
 While price heterogeneity has been incorporated in poverty measurement
 from the start, consensus is building that specificity also requires different
 bundles for different spatial or temporal domains .
 Explain why this is going to be the case especially in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue of specificity of the poverty line is especially important in
 Uganda.
 Uganda has large regional variations in diet within the country, with no
 less than six major food staples being eaten 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:12:y:2003:i:4:p:598-624"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, matooke, or cooking banans, is mainly eaten in the West,
 and to a lesser extend in Central region.
 Households living in the dryer North, however, obtain a substantial share
 of their calories throught sorghum and sesame.
 These diets are not only determined by custom, they are also related to
 the agro-geological characteristics, such as the dry North that is more
 suited for cassava then matooke.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While differences in consumption baskets are interesting in its own right,
 they only become relevant in the context of poverty measurement and analysis
 when we evaluate the cost of these basic need.
 Indeed, what matters for poverty comparisons is that different diets may
 provide the same basic needs (usually a given amount of kcal per day per
 adult equivalent) at significanlty differnt cost.
 It is especially in this regard that Uganda is an interesting case.
 Cassava, the main ingredient in the diet of households in the West is a
 very expensive source of food energy, almost three times as expensive as
 sorghum that is consumed in the North.
 As such, to compare the West to the North on the basis of the same daily
 nutritional requirements, the West will need a much higher poverty line.

\begin_layout Section
Poverty in Uganda - Recent Trends and Controversies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put here some tables with recent trends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Refer to the World Bank paper on poverty estimates.
 Also refer to Lisa Daniels her paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One reason why poverty estimates do not seem to reflect reality may be due
 to the fact that the national poverty line only allows for differences
 in prices over space.
 However, it is well known that Uganda has a very diversified set of staples,
 in part reflecting the cultural and geographical diversity of the coutnry.
 Most of these staple foods are not widely traded.
 Table XXX, reproduced from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, shows that sweet potatoes, and cassava to a lesser extend, are consumed
 throughout the country.
 Matooke, on the other hand, is mainly consumed in Western and Central Uganda.
 Sorghum is an important staple in the rural areas in the North.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason why differences in diets are important for poverty measurement
 is because these diets may have a different cost for each calorie they
 provide.
 For example, one kcal obtained from matooke consumption costs almost three
 times as much as a kcal obtained from sorghum.
 Given this observations, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:12:y:2003:i:4:p:598-624"

\end_inset

 calculates simple regional poverty lines by calculating the cost (at national
 median prices) of 3000 kcal per day per adult given the typical food basket
 of the poor in each region
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is important to realize that the regional poverty lines do not stem from
 regional differences in prices, but rather from differences in diets which
 have different cost.
 Poverty lines adjusted for price levels is what people normally have in
 mind if they think of regional poverty lines.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Not surprisingly, this leads to significantly higer poverty lines in West,
 where diets are composed of the expensive matooke for a considerable part.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interesting observation form 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:oup:jafrec:v:12:y:2003:i:4:p:598-624"

\end_inset

 is that when he allows for differences in income, Western region becomes
 the poorest region instead of the North.

\begin_layout Section
Utility Consistent Poverty Lines using Revealed Preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea uses the rationality assumption that economic agent that derive
 utility from consumption always prefere consuming more to less.
 Let us assume that a representative agent living in spatial domain 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $(r\in R)$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
derives utility from a set of consumption goods (
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

).
 We will then instruct each representative consumer in each spatial domain
 
\emph on
r 
\emph default
to spend a minimum to attain an arbitrary (but constant accros spatial domains)
 level of utility.
 As such, each individual will spend 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 on a consumption bundle, with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the price of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i,r}$
\end_inset

 the price of good 
\emph on
i
\emph default
 in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
.
 Revealed preference conditions wil then imply that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum p_{i,r}q_{ir'}\geq\sum p_{i,r}q_{i,r}\;\forall r,r'\label{eq:revpref}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is so because the representative consumer in spatial domain 
\emph on
r
\emph default
 will choose only that bundle that minimizes expenditure.
 Thus, any other bundle that yields the same level of utility (such as for
 instance the one chosen by the representative consumer in region 
\emph on
r'
\emph default
) should be equally or more expensive than the chosen bundel.
 There can be no bundle that costs less than the chosen one, because then
 the rational consumer should have chosen that one.
 The above condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:revpref"

\end_inset

 should hold for all possible pairs of spatial domains.

\begin_layout Section
A Reassesment of Poverty in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will look at data taken from thee different surveys.
 The oldest is the Uganda National Household Survey conducted in 2005/06.
 The second is the Uganda National Household survey conducted in 2009/10.
 Finally, we will also run the analysis on the second wave of the Uganda
 National Panel Survey (2010/11).
 Unfortunately, this last survey is much smaller than the previous surveys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each dataset, we will start by constructing new food bundles in each
 spatial domain.
 For Uganda, we will use the rural parts of the four regions seperately
 and take all urban areas (including Kampala) togehter as one spatial domain.
 In each poverty line region, a basket of food products that satisfied basic
 calorie needs (WHO 1985) was identified using information on the age and
 sex composition of the household and the recorded consumption patterns
 of poorer households.
 The cost of this basket, valued at prices prevailing within each region,
 is the food poverty line in each region.
 A nonfood poverty line was obtained for each region by calculating the
 share of food expenditures for households whose total food and nonfood
 consumption per capita was near the food poverty line.
 The total poverty line is obtained as the sum of the food and the nonfood
 poverty lines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be instructive to have a closer look at the poverty lines.
 After all, poverty lines are not only usefull
