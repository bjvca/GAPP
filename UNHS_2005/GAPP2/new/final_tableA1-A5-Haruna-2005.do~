** replicated below in the survey quarters and months better thus might be a repeat to do it here.

***------- Interview Quarter
* For the Mozambique Data, instead of using the regular quarter definition for their "surquar" variable they defined the quarters
* relative to the time period covered by the survey: the survey ran from Sept 2008 to August 2009 so they defined the quarters
* as follows: Sept-Nov 08, Dec08-Feb09, Mar-May 08 and June-Aug 08.
* I will use the same framework

** and Kaberamaido; Mid-Northern included Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Apac, and Lira; West Nile includes Moyo, Adjumani, Yumbe, Arua,

** Kayunga, Kiboga, Luwero, Mubende, Mukono and Nakasongola; East Central includes Jinja, Iganga, Kamuli, Bugiri and

** in 2005 data, the smallest section is the northern urban which has 344, households; therefore, we would generate the spatial domains on the

** in Mozambique, so we have 9 spatial domains

***----- Household members
*According to the enumerator manual of 2005/06, Usual and Regular household members are defined as follows:

*Usual members are defined as those persons who have been living in the household for 6 months or
*more during the last 12 months. However, members who have come to stay in the household permanently
*are to be included as usual members, even though they have lived in this household for less than 6
*months. Furthermore, children born to usual members on any date during the last 12 months will be taken
*as usual members. Both these categories will be given code "1" or "2" depending upon whether they are
*present or absent on the date of the interview.

*Regular members refer to those persons who would have been usual members of this household, but
*have been away for more than six months during the last 12 months, for education purposes, search of
*employment, business transactions etc. and living in boarding schools, lodging houses or hostels etc.
*These categories will be given code "3" or "4" depending upon presence or absence on the date of the
*interview. */

 
* For the purposes of the calculation of a poverty line we'll exclude from the household the members who have left 
* the household permanently or died
*  We'll keep the members away for more than 6 months but present on the day of the interview
