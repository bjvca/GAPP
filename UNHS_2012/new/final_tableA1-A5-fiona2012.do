* For the Mozambique Data, instead of using the regular quarter definition for their "surquar" variable they defined the quarters
* relative to the time period covered by the survey: the survey ran from Sept 2008 to August 2009 so they defined the quarters
* as follows: Sept-Nov 08, Dec08-Feb09, Mar-May 08 and June-Aug 08.

***------- Geographical Stratification during sampling
* this was not there as was with 2009, therefore we shall generate "strata" from the distict and region variables here. the 2009 UBOS 
** has explanations for what districts belong to which sub regions, so we shall use that to build our strata variable. UBOS 2009/10 report had described them
** as follows: Notes: Sub-region of North East includes the districts of Kor04o, Moroto, Nakapiripiriti, Katwaki, Amuria, Soroti, Kumi
** and Kaberamaido; Mid-Northern included Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Apac, and Lira; West Nile includes Moyo, Adjumani, Yumbe, Arua, 
**Koboko, and Nebbi; Mid-Western includes Masindi, Hoima, Kibaale, Bundibugyo, Kabarole, Kasese, Kyenjojo and Kamwenge; South Western includes 
**  Bushenyi, Rukungiri, Kanungu, Kabale, Kisoro, Mbarara, and Ntungamo; Eastern includes Kapchorwa, Mbale,
** Tororo, Sironko, Paliisa, and Busia; Central 1 includes Kalangala, Masaka, Mpigi, Rakai, Sembabule and Wakiso; Central 2 includes
** Kayunga, Kiboga, Luwero, Mubende, Mukono and Nakasongola; East Central includes Jinja, Iganga, Kamuli, Bugiri and 
** Mayuge; and Kampala. We have used the same nomenclature

* to ensure that the right districts had been used for the right sub-regions (strata), we checked this by tabbing these sub-regions with rural/urban description and then
** tabbed the big regions (region) with substrat to ensure that the total numbers of Urban/Rural are the same in both
tab strata substrat

*--> for uganda; urban sub regions of eastern, northern and western had very few households 132, 172, 107 respectively, 
** thus we only separated the central region into rural/urban and others were aggregated for northern, eastern and western to have 5 spatial domains

***----- Household members
*According to the enumerator manual of 2005/06, Usual and Regular household members are defined as follows:

*Usual members are defined as those persons who have been living in the household for 6 months or
*more during the last 12 months. However, members who have come to stay in the household permanently
*are to be included as usual members, even though they have lived in this household for less than 6
*months. Furthermore, children born to usual members on any date during the last 12 months will be taken
*as usual members. Both these categories will be given code "1" or "2" depending upon whether they are
*present or absent on the date of the interview.

*Regular members refer to those persons who would have been usual members of this household, but
*have been away for more than six months during the last 12 months, for education purposes, search of
*employment, business transactions etc. and living in boarding schools, lodging houses or hostels etc.
*These categories will be given code "3" or "4" depending upon presence or absence on the date of the
*interview. */

 
* For the purposes of the calculation of a poverty line we'll exclude from the household the members who have left 
* the household permanently or died
*  We'll keep the members away for more than 6 months but present on the day of the interview
